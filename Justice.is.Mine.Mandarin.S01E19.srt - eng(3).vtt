WEBVTT

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.359
He'll be out in a month?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.320
That means his sentence
is reduced by four months.

00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:06.373
Yes.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.000
That's great.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.920
When Yi Wei gets out,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.640
he has to stay here with me first.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.319
I have to fatten him up first.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.639
He's too skinny now.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.280
There must be no good food in there.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.559
He needs to take care of his health
while he's young.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.320
Otherwise,
there'll be trouble later.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.800
Let's talk about that later.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.880
I'm serious.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.960
After Yi Wei is released,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.320
I don't want him to live with you.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.560
I think you've changed a lot lately.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.920
You weren't like this before.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.839
I don't know what happened.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.959
In the past six months,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.640
the big cases you ruled on...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.280
were really scary.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.000
Take Shi Zhi Yang's case
for example.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.319
Everyone could see...

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.560
that the witness had a problem.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.919
But you didn't question it...

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.280
and directly made a verdict.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440
You indeed overturned it later,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.600
but if you were
in your right mind at the time,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.920
you wouldn't have had to
apologize for your mistake.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.640
There's the land deed case too.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.520
There has been
a lot of commotion lately.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.239
They were on a hunger strike,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.520
and someone almost got killed.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.000
Even though that land deed...

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.680
might not be legal,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.600
the law doesn't just protect...

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.080
the terms of a document.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.599
Humanity and justice...

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.280
must also exist.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.119
Then do you think we can use...

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.280
humanity and justice...

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.999
to win the chance for an appeal?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Of course.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.360
I'll leave it to you then.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.080
Leave it to me?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.240
(Justice is Mine)

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.320
(Episode 19)

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.040
The wounded victim
is in the ICU now.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.200
Tetanus has infected
his internal organs.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.840
He is in critical condition.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.679
Blame the unscrupulous
real estate developers!

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.759
How could they block my way?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760
How dare they fence up my land?

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.159
That's no reason for you
to hurt someone.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.160
I didn't.

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:20.760
I just wanted
to take down the fence.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.960
You were holding a sharp
and rusty weapon.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.399
It could kill someone at any time.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.000
Chang Gui made me take it.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
Really?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.720
I just randomly grabbed it.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.439
I took it from his house.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.440
Hey, man.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.959
We wanted to take down the fence.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.136
We didn't plan to kill anyone.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.479
We're fighting against tyranny...

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.480
and unscrupulous
real estate developers!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.480
Shut up!

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
Cut the crap.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600
Xu Da Niu said...

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.480
he was originally
standing at the back.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.360
Suddenly, he was pushed
to the front.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.400
That's how he accidentally
hurt the victim.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.000
It was so chaotic.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.800
I was pushed too, Madam.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.960
It was so chaotic.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.880
How could you tell which rod...

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.400
was sharp enough to hurt someone,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840
and which one...

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480
was not?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.240
Is there a new rule?

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.999
Do I not get any privacy...

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.720
as your boss now?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.360
I give up. Tell me.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.320
What else is there to say?

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560
The bad guy...

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:32.416
is allowed to freely walk out
of the police station,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.480
while the idiot...

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.040
not only has to take the blame,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.800
but he'll also be charged.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.559
Qi Chang Gui was released?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.560
Of course.

00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:40.696
There wasn't enough evidence.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.520
What else could we do?
Keep detaining him?

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.280
No matter what,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.999
the truth is that...

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.280
someone was seriously injured.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.000
You're a cop.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.400
You have to enforce the law.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760
You...

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640
Granduncle.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.200
I know you like tea.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.200
So I got someone...

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.320
to bring you some old Pu'er tea.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.280
We can drink tea anytime.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.720
I'm sure you all know...

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.960
that Da Niu has been arrested
by the police.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.920
Mr. Zeng is in the hospital
because of the hunger strike.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.560
So Granduncle said...

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Forget it.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440
Let's sell it.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
You're willing to sell it?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
Let's sell.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.159
No way.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160
We can't do that.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.600
It can't be helped.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.080
It's an inevitable trend
of the future.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.400
The redevelopment
of the Old City District...

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.480
is a good thing in the long run.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.480
Then Chang Rong, negotiate
with them on everyone's behalf.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.320
The most important thing is
we get new replacement houses.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.720
We will not accept a penny less...

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.200
for the demolition compensation.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.600
If you can successfully
negotiate this,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.079
you'll be the hero
of our district, Chang Rong.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.080
No, don't say that.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.080
Come on.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.200
Let me toast you with this tea
instead of wine.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.200
- Here.
- Please don't, Granduncle.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.800
It's my duty.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.616
- Have some tea.
- All right.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.640
- Granduncle, drink the tea.
- Let's drink tea.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640
Let's all have some tea.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720
Chang Rong.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.840
You indeed have your ways.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240
This move using Da Niu...

00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:19.401
was incredible, like an elephant
flying across a river.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.680
All right.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.960
You contributed too.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.199
You'll get your share.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200
Of course.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.600
I risked my life for this.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.640
Why are you still
standing here then?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.720
Go and keep an eye on them!

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
I got it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It hurts.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.280
Chang Rong.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320
Mr. Ruan.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920
Do you need something?

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.279
You're so close to the chairman.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.440
I want you to ask him
about selling our house.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.680
Selling your house?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.919
Since everyone is selling,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.960
are you selling yours too?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.359
We bought our house...

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.440
when Wei married Sha Sha.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.200
It's in Sha Sha's name.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.040
Now that Wei is gone,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.839
Sha Sha is out there working...

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.176
while taking care of the children.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.416
There's no one to sign the deal,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.040
so we can't even sell it.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160
That's easy.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.440
Just write a power of attorney.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.080
Does that work?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160
Of course.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.280
Mr. Qi.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760
Go inside.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760
Go back to your room.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.120
Why are you hiding from me
as if you've seen a ghost?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.319
I let you live with your kids.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.520
You didn't even thank me,
and you're giving me attitude.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760
Come here.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.840
I said, come here!

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.960
Sign it.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.560
What is this?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.520
It's good stuff.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.600
Our Old City District...

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.880
is being redeveloped
by a real estate developer.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.240
They're giving you a new house
plus compensation.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.480
It's for the house
under your name,

00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:11.920
where your parents live.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.040
You need to sign
this power of attorney.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.440
Let me see my parents.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.280
I let you call them once a month
to say you're safe.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.080
I just do that
to get some good karma.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.799
Don't push your luck.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.400
Don't force me
to take the kids away from you.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.760
When are you going to let me go?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520
It depends on my mood.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.720
If you behave well,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440
then we'll see.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.640
We've reached
the land acquisition target.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.640
The Old City District
land development...

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.160
is finally underway.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.880
I'd like to thank both of you
for your strong support.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400
Thank you.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.320
Don't just say thank you.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.079
Most importantly,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.056
remember to give me a couple
of gambling licenses later.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.919
Remember the swap I did.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.039
If it weren't for me,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.319
there's no way...

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.096
you'd have been able
to acquire the land legally.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.480
If we didn't have the judge's son
as a bargaining chip,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.640
what could a piece of paper do?

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.696
Anyway, both of you are
key contributors to our success.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.039
We'll surely share...

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.440
our profits with you in the future.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.040
Anyway, my mission is complete.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.800
As for the rest,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.920
that's up to you, Young Master Lie.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.240
I heard the judge's son...

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.760
will be released early.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.600
He'll be released sooner or later.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.720
Just think of it
as offering him a carrot.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.039
The land acquisition was a success,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.376
and construction
is officially underway.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.480
I've accomplished my mission.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.000
Whatever you do later on...

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.760
is not my business.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.280
Come on. Eat it while it's hot.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.600
Okay, thank you.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680
Have a shrimp.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400
Yi Wei.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.960
Why are you...

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.520
getting skinnier and skinnier?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.120
I'm almost the same as before.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320
Have you been reading?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.200
You'll be out soon.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600
Grandma said...

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.279
she'll buy you lots of good food...

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280
and fatten you up.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280
Dad.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Actually,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.160
I don't have to get out early.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240
What did you say?

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.920
I only have a few more months.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.320
I can do it.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480
- Are you saying...
- Dad.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480
When I used to...

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.680
watch you in court...

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.520
in your judge's robe,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.440
I really thought you looked cool.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.400
I wonder
if I'll get to see it again.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.760
You will.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.960
I'll take you home soon.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Hang in there, okay?

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.760
Out with the old,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.000
in with the new.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.760
Society is constantly evolving.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.200
That's why...

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.960
the future
of the Old City District...

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.000
will only get better.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.119
- Well said!
- Great!

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120
Well said!

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440
Mr. Zhong.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.280
You can't say that.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.080
Although development
is the future trend,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.600
old things
also have historical value.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.096
On behalf of the residents
of the Old City District,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.879
I hope you can preserve
the Dawang Temple.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.880
That's impossible.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.280
According to our plan,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.879
all the buildings in this area...

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.720
must be razed to the ground.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600
How can you do that?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.040
- Why?
- That's right!

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.679
- How can they do that?
- That's too much.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.839
- Granduncle is here.
- How can they do that?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.279
- Granduncle is here.
- Granduncle!

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.520
- Granduncle is here.
- I think it's entirely possible...

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.080
to preserve the Dawang Temple.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.120
My name is Zhou Luo Wen.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.160
I am Granduncle Chen's lawyer.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.920
On behalf of the Old City District,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.560
I've applied for an injunction...

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.480
based on procedural justice.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.079
I know...

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.719
I truly let everyone down.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.559
I failed to protect our homeland.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.280
But now,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.999
there has been a turn of events.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.679
I hope everyone...

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.199
can continue to support me.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.399
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.039
- Support Granduncle!
- Support Granduncle!

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.920
- Support Granduncle!
- Support Granduncle!

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.880
- Support Granduncle!
- Arrange what's necessary.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.696
- Support Granduncle!
- Support Granduncle!

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.056
- Support Granduncle!
- Support Granduncle!

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.280
- Support Granduncle!
- Support Granduncle!

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.000
What is the meaning of this?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.760
Procedural justice...

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.520
can only be cited
if it involves public interest.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080
How unfortunate.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.320
I can't believe
they found grounds for appeal.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.080
This lawyer, Ms. Zhou,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.720
used to be your student, right?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760
Yes.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.200
A student challenging her mentor...

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.600
It's like a duel in a court.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.440
I'd do the same if I were her.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.120
If I win, everyone will know me.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.320
If I lose,
I'd just be losing to my mentor.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.160
So, what are your chances
of winning?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080
Don't worry.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.720
They don't have any new evidence.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.040
The appeal is just a formality.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.360
You don't have to worry.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.960
When is the retrial?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.599
If we stop the construction now,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.440
the real estate developer
will lose a lot.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.040
I estimate...

00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:05.200
it'll be in a week.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.240
Don't worry.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.800
I've been in a good mood lately.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.640
My cases have all
been going smoothly.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.320
A good mood?

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.360
My son will be released early.
Don't you remember?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960
I do.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.160
If we win this case,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.240
and your son gets his freedom again,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.439
it'll be a double celebration.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.440
That's right.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.959
Once my son is released,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.440
and we win this case,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.800
it'll indeed be
a double celebration.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.080
You got a new car.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.840
Luo Wen.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.200
I'm not telling you anything.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.160
And don't try or intend...

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.760
to teach me how to do my job.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.200
I just wanted
to say that your bag is open.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.119
The land dispute...

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.480
is a civil matter.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.560
Both parties are present.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.319
Let's see if we can communicate...

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320
and reach a settlement.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.880
The only condition...

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.399
that my client
can accept is that the developer...

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.720
must respect the land ownership
of the Old City District.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.479
Only then...

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.040
will there be any room
for a settlement.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.360
The court ruled
that the deed was forged,

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.720
so the land ownership doesn't exist.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.439
The land will be returned
to the government...

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.600
and given to the real estate
developer for development.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.160
We respect the law.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.360
At the same time,

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.640
we respect the historical
significance of the land,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.920
especially the indigenous people...

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.079
who have lived there for centuries.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080
Prosecution Counsel.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.080
Can history put food on the table?

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.120
And regarding some things,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.640
if they're real, they're real.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.080
If they're fake,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120
they're still fake.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.840
My land deed is real!

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.120
Your Honor!

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.720
The land deed is truly real!

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760
Prosecution Counsel.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.479
Remind your client...

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480
to stay calm.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.920
Calm down.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.840
The prosecution is challenging...

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.720
Appraisal Report Number 08...

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760
from the first trial.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.599
We hope the court will approve
a re-appraisal...

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.240
of this important piece of evidence.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400
Objection.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.279
The expert witness used
state-of-the-art instruments...

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.280
for their appraisal.

00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:37.761
Even if it's repeated
a hundred times,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960
the result...

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.280
will be the same.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400
The result...

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.040
affects public interest.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.999
If a re-appraisal is not approved,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.440
it violates procedural justice.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.799
This is the reason
for my client's appeal.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.120
Objection. There's no need
to waste anyone's time.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.359
This court agrees
that the plaintiff...

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.720
has sufficient grounds for appeal.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.359
This case will be retried...

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360
in one week.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.600
Congratulations.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.120
You successfully filed an appeal
for this land case.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.720
I'm not good
at these kinds of cases.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.239
Thank you for reminding me...

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.040
to appeal using procedural justice.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.120
Just gain more experience
in these cases.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.080
Then, no case
will be too difficult for you.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.640
I still don't quite understand.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720
Why...

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.280
did you come to me?

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.120
I mean,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.720
why did you ask me to do this?

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.320
I may be retired,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.560
but I'm still a judge.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.040
My mission to uphold justice...

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.040
has always been in my heart.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.120
I'm just doing what I should.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.960
Not every judge is like you.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.400
At least,

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.000
Judge Qin isn't.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.800
It's because he's the opponent.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280
You know very well...

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.959
that many lawyers...

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.359
wouldn't dare to offend...

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.600
the Chief Justice.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040
I came to you...

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.040
because I know you have the courage.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.136
I'm happy to be a part of a fight...

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.200
against collusion between
officials and businessmen.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.880
This proves I didn't come
to the wrong person.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640
Hello.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640
Qin Yu.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.800
Help me.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240
Mrs. Cao?

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.040
Hello? Hello?

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.320
That's all. Clean it up yourself.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.400
Do you have Sha Sha's number?

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.240
Sha Sha only calls once a month.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.239
She said it's inconvenient...

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.320
where she works now.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.800
- So we don't have her number.
- That's right.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.360
Our house is in Sha Sha's name.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.640
To sell the house,
we need a power of attorney.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.920
We had to ask
for Qi Chang Rong's help.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.880
Keep an eye
on the Old City District,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.600
especially that lawyer.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.599
It's useless
no matter what she does.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.760
Don't you have the real deed?

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560
What a rare guest.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.880
- Judge Qin, have a seat.
- Okay.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.439
I asked you to come out
so many times,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.520
but you were always busy.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.240
I've been busy
with the land deed case.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.760
But everything is fine now.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.760
Welcome.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.360
Waiter, set an extra place, please.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.600
- You guys eat. Don't wait for me.
- Sure.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.080
I can't believe I have the honor...

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.240
to dine with the Chief Justice.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.376
You're always like this
every time I see you.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400
It's no fun.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.880
Let me give you a gift.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.559
Think of it as compensation...

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.800
for shooting you.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.520
You want to make peace?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.840
Cao Wei Er had insurance
before he died.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.240
I helped him set it up.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.740
There's about...

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:12.793
over two million.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.680
Are you kidding me?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.559
Are you going to dig up his body...

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.999
and get a death certificate?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.360
I just need to be the notary.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.840
But his widow must sign it herself,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.520
as she's the sole beneficiary.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.880
It has to be signed by Ruan Sha?

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.279
I haven't seen her in a long time.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.360
I don't know where she is.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.399
When Ruan Sha's dad sold his house,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.480
didn't you give him...

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.040
the power of attorney yourself?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.360
You're really well-informed.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240
I didn't do anything.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
All I want...

00:20:54.001 --> 00:20:55.680
is for my son to get out of jail...

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.800
and live a normal life with him.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.480
I...

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.520
don't want to bring up the past.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560
Is that so?

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.039
Two million?

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.320
Not taking it would just benefit
the insurance company.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.280
Can you help me save someone?

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.960
What do you mean?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.599
Check this number.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.719
Where was the location...

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.920
when it made a call yesterday?

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.800
Only the police have permission...

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.920
to access
the telecom company's data.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160
Who are we saving?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.320
Cao Wei Er's wife and kids.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.440
Over two million HKD?

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.160
Do you believe that?

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.160
You don't?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.000
Would I believe him?

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.600
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.720
He wants me dead.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.480
That's true.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840
However,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.280
he's right about one thing.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.800
Once the land deed case is settled,

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.600
it's time for us...

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.720
to settle the old score.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.080
He walked right into our hands.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.856
According to the telecom company's
records,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.999
the location from this number...

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
is Baini Island.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.480
If this is really
Qi Chang Rong's hideout,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.200
maybe we'll be
in for a surprise, Madam.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.680
It's Qi Chang Rong's
drug warehouse.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760
What did they teach us
in the first lesson...

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960
at the police academy?

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.840
What's more important?

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.680
Catching criminals or saving lives?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.000
Saving lives, of course.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.000
But the question is,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400
do you trust Qin Yu?

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.840
Not entirely.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.080
But I went to Ruan Sha's house
and asked.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.240
There's indeed
something strange going on.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.120
So, I asked someone else...

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.920
who is also
from the Old City District.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.080
Qi Chang Rong was just
a small fry back then.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.560
He and Cao Wei Er
both courted Ruan Sha.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.559
In the end, Ruan Sha...

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.919
chose Cao Wei Er,
who was a police officer.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.199
Qi Chang Rong was humiliated.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.360
Of course, he was angry.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.456
There are no secrets
in the Old City District.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
Everyone knew about it.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.800
What puzzles me the most now...

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.680
is Cao Wei Er's death.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.640
No one knows what happened to him.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.040
They only know he was injured.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.560
But he didn't dare to go
to the hospital with his injury.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.200
And on the day he was injured,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.360
a shipment of firearms was stolen.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640
And the next day,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.239
Qi Chang Rong was almost killed...

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.800
by that batch of firearms.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.720
All signs indicate...

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.760
that Ruan Sha's current situation...

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920
is very dangerous.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.720
Our operation plan should be...

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880
to save her first,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920
then arrest the suspect.

00:23:24.921 --> 00:23:25.961
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.600
This is Cao We Er's
death certificate.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880
Once you arrange a time,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.056
I'll have one of my officers...

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.760
pose as an insurance worker.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.360
This operation will be dangerous.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.880
You're not a cop.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.160
You shouldn't be involved.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.800
If I don't show up,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.600
Qi Chang Rong will get suspicious.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.760
If you use force,

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.559
I'm afraid Ruan Sha
and her two children...

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560
will be in danger.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.959
I really want to know why...

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.960
you're risking your life...

00:24:01.961 --> 00:24:03.200
to save them.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.480
That's right.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960
I owe it to them.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.000
Do you accept my analysis?

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.080
I trust you'll protect me.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440
My people...

00:24:16.441 --> 00:24:17.761
will be on standby on the island.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840
Be careful.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160
Okay.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.680
- Mr. Gui.
- Mr. Gui.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880
Chang Rong.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.239
Welcome.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.240
Please, have a seat.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.640
Long time no see.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.920
How are the kids?

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.559
They're resting in their room.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.560
They're in their room?

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.960
Let's get down to business.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.959
This is Ms. Tan, a representative
from the insurance company.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.960
Ms. Tan.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400
I'm sorry...

00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:20.880
for making you come all this way.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.200
I'm used to it.

00:25:22.201 --> 00:25:23.841
We go around
to meet clients all the time.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.359
Ms. Ruan, I need your ID...

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.040
and the insured's death certificate.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520
Here.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.880
Here's the death certificate.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.440
Team A and B, stand by.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.480
Wait for my order.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.359
We have everything we need.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.280
Please sign here, Ms. Ruan.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960
By the way,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.240
when's the earliest
we can get the money?

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.719
As soon as the paperwork is done.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720
It won't take long.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.800
Okay.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.840
I'll see you out.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720
You stay here.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.360
Your kids are still in the room.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.360
I'm just seeing Judge Qin out.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Him?

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.680
He's not leaving.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.200
He's staying to chat with me.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480
We're going to catch up.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200
Ms. Tan.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.640
Your bag looks heavy.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.000
- Let me help you.
- It's okay.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.560
Team B, move in.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.080
The two kids have been rescued.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.440
Copy that.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.800
- Come on, let me help you.
- It's okay.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.240
Chang Rong, the police are here!

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.320
Action!

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680
You set me up!

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.240
Hands up!

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.720
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600
No!

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.840
Judge Qin!

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400
Judge Qin!

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.560
Call an ambulance.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440
Madam.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.480
It's indeed
Qi Chang Rong's drug den.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760
I'll follow up on this.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080
Madam.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.639
Qi Chang Rong is confirmed dead.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.680
Judge Qin is fine.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.799
- Be careful.
- Grandpa! Grandma!

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.399
- Dad, Mom.
- You're back.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.400
Kids.

00:28:09.401 --> 00:28:10.720
Dad, Mom.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.560
It's good that you're safe.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.160
Grandma.

00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:15.401
Let Grandma take a look at you.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.456
- You can't stay here anymore.
- You're so skinny now.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.560
Pack your things.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.920
Someone will escort you
to a safe place.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.960
Once the situation stabilizes,

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.320
we'll decide what to do.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.840
Thank you.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.200
You should thank Judge Qin.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.920
Between him and me,
we don't have to say "thank you".

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800
Get some rest.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.479
Tomorrow, we'll need you...

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.280
to come to the police station
for a statement.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.880
Thank you.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.200
At the time, it was chaotic.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.976
It seemed like Qi Chang Rong...

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.680
wanted to kill us like a madman.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.720
Judge Qin...

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.600
jumped on him to stop him.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.400
You set me up!

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.160
Then, there was a gunshot.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.840
They both fell to the ground.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.320
Then, they started moving.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.439
The one who stood up...

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.480
was Qi Chang Rong.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.680
Although I was wearing
a bulletproof vest,

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.719
the moment I was shot,

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720
I fainted.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720
No!

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.160
I knew he was
going to kill us, so...

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.280
I picked up his gun
and pointed it at him.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.560
I don't know
what happened after that.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920
Don't do anything stupid.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.960
Think about your parents
and your children.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520
I killed him.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.360
Shoot again.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440
Shoot me.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.760
What did the autopsy report say?

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.896
It was a gunshot wound
to the carotid artery.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.160
It was one of the fatal wounds.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.880
There was also a severe blow
to the back of the head.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.080
But the two injuries...

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.400
happened too close together.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.919
Forensics can't determine...

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.520
the sequence of events either.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.440
If he hit his head first,

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.479
maybe Qi Chang Rong...

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.880
was already too weak to fight back.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.080
If he was shot
in the neck after that,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.320
it wouldn't be self-defense.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.640
It'd be murder.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.200
But Qin Yu,
the only witness at the time,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.880
said he had fainted.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.000
He didn't see anything.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.760
Withholding information...

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.000
is obstruction of justice.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720
Are you sure?

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.200
I'm not sure.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.599
A widow and her kids...

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.400
was held captive for half a year.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.200
They were living in fear.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.280
Even the medical examiner...

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.760
cannot determine
how this scumbag died.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.000
Isn't this a good outcome?

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.640
What are your plans for the future?

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.760
I don't want to have anything
to do with you anymore.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.240
I'm sorry.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.319
From now on,

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.800
we have nothing to do
with each other.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.560
We'll live our own lives.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.680
If you ever need my help,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.960
I'll be there.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.536
Now that the Old City Gang
is disbanded,

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.840
the Han family is unrivaled now.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.680
Isn't that your dream?

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840
What do you want from me?

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.640
You're quite something.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.160
You...

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.200
got rid of Qi Chang Rong
just like that.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.840
But it's a pity.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.160
Although the Han family
is unrivaled now,

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040
my dad and brother...

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160
can't see it anymore.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.880
Enjoy your time with your family.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.920
You don't have much time left.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.760
We'll see.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200
He's out.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.040
Let's go home. Come on.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.560
The councilor really released him.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.640
Young Master Lie.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.280
When should we make a move on him?

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.240
He doesn't know what his son
has become yet.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.760
Give him some time.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040
There's no rush.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.600
You've lost so much weight.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.680
You need to eat more.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.520
I've made soup.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.120
I'll cook for you later.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.440
I'm a bit tired.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.720
I'm going to rest first.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.840
He seems different from before.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.560
That's how people are.

00:36:09.561 --> 00:36:10.599
When you're
in a different environment,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.720
there's bound to be changes.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.239
I need to work
on the land deed case lately.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.240
I might be quite busy.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320
If you have time,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.320
come see him more often.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040
I'll go and make dinner.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.040
Today's agenda...

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.359
is recusal,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.120
the list of witnesses
who'll appear in court,

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.640
and the exclusion of false evidence.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.320
Now that both sides are present,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840
we may begin.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.280
Your Honor.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.079
The prosecution
has specially invited...

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.120
an internationally
recognized expert on artifacts...

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.040
to reappraise the deed.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.720
The prosecution requests...

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.359
to hold the trial...

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.416
after the appraisal results are out.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.520
How many days will it take?

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.560
About five days.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.520
I'll give you three days.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.280
Due to procedural fairness,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.840
I respect your request.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.400
But we also need to consider...

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.600
the progress of the case.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.040
Understood.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.840
Judge Qin.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.280
Are you going to approve
whatever they ask for?

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120
Hey, you...

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.920
Someone complained
about your attitude.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.160
That's not like you.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.360
I'm a judge,

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.600
not a goodwill ambassador.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.080
Please tell your friend...

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.120
to consider the situation
before he speaks.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.399
His nonsense...

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.560
won't do anyone any good.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120
That's true.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.120
This is a critical moment.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.680
It's better to be safe.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.560
The most important thing...

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.920
is still the land deed.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.680
Don't worry.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.760
We have security guards here...

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.760
24 hours a day.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240
That's good.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.320
- Councilor Huang.
- What is it?

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.040
Well...

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160
He's here again.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.800
Didn't we settle things last time?

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.480
He's here to thank you.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.096
He wants to take a photo with you...

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.360
and publish it in the magazine.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.216
I'm sorry.
I need to entertain this guest.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.240
Okay.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.320
I forgot my phone.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.440
Councilor Huang.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.720
We're ready downstairs.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.439
The reporter has an urgent matter.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440
He's in a hurry to leave.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.240
Why don't we take the photo now?

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.560
Hello, everyone.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.559
- Councilor Huang.
- Welcome.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.759
- Councilor Huang.
- Councilor.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.239
Can I take a photo with you?

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.880
Of course, come on.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680
Come on.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.399
- All right.
- Let's take a photo!

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.120
Okay, look at the camera.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.320
All right.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.079
Councilor Huang,
you have to help us.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.400
Yes, Councilor Huang.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.160
Thank you, Councilor Huang.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.079
Councilor Huang is the best!

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.120
Thank you.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.960
Xiao Yue.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.480
Judge Qin.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.799
I listened to you...

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.600
and talked to the councilor.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.039
The councilor...

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.799
really talked to our manager.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.199
We now get equal pay
for equal work.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.320
Equal pay for equal work!

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.440
That's good.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.640
I...

00:40:53.641 --> 00:40:55.080
I did as you said...

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.840
and went at that time.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.519
I wasn't late, right?

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.960
You were right on time. Thank you.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.720
I should be the one thanking you.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.760
You were the one...

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.760
who ruled me not guilty in court.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960
Xiao Yue.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.879
Take this money to buy yourself
and your friends a good meal.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.880
Be careful from now on.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.759
The Court of Appeals
will be retrialing...

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.959
the Old City District
land deed dispute...

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.199
that has been the talk of the town.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.639
- Excuse me.
- The case was appealed...

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.040
on the basis of procedural justice.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.800
Let us see how the case will unfold.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.960
According to Clause 3
in Article 251...

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.280
of the Criminal Code,

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.080
and Clause 2 in Article 145
of the Constitution,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.920
the ruling is as follows.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.896
In accordance
with the new appraisal results...

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.200
submitted by the appellant,

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.000
the court revokes
its previous ruling...

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.800
the Old City District land deed...

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.480
was a forgery.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320
Secondly,

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.440
the court supports...

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.400
the Old City District residents'
rights and assertions of their land.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.880
Each resident...

00:42:00.881 --> 00:42:02.600
has the right to decide...

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.080
whether their homes...

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.040
are to be sold or renovated.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.640
If the defense is to continue
their construction activities,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.159
you must come to an agreement...

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.680
with all the residents
in the district.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.280
- That's great!
- Great!

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680
Granduncle.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.880
We won.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.760
Ms. Zhou, thank you.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880
Ms. Zhou.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.239
Thank you.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.399
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.759
- You're welcome.
- You're our district's savior.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.479
- That's right.
- Congratulations.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.560
Thank you!

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
- Thank you, Ms. Zhou!
- Thank you, Ms. Zhou!

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320
What are you doing?

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.239
You overturned your own ruling.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.480
How am I going to explain this?

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.400
The prosecution presented
compelling evidence.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.720
Moreover, the case
has such a huge social impact.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.559
I just did...

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.800
what a Chief Justice should do.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.040
Don't forget how you became
the Chief Justice.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.720
I was were appointed
by the Executive.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.040
I advise your people...

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.080
to appeal
to the Court of Final Appeal.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.519
You know better than I do...

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.560
how long that will take.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960
I can't wait.

00:43:12.961 --> 00:43:14.119
The developers can't wait.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120
The people behind me...

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.720
especially can't afford to wait.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.880
If anything happens
to the Chief Justice...

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.720
at this critical moment,

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.079
it will definitely affect...

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.960
the Court of Final Appeal's stance
on this case.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.240
Take your chance.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.160
Judge Shen, thank you.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.600
I learned a lot from this case.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.640
It also helped me
regain my confidence.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.760
That's great.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.240
But did my mentor...

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.440
Did Judge Qin really
have nothing to do with this?

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.120
Why do you ask?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.040
Isn't he best...

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.840
at using different methods...

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.519
to use the people around him...

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.520
to achieve his goals?

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.200
You're overthinking it.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.120
Maybe I am.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.280
Don't bother seeing me out.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.760
Take care.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.480
Thank you.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.600
You're already here.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.200
I know she really wants to see you.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.680
It's good the way it is now.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.320
She doesn't know
that someone swapped the deed.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.880
All she knows
is that she won a case.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.320
She has regained her confidence.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.360
That's what I wanted to see most.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.720
You're her mentor.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.120
Just think of it
as giving her the best gift.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440
Young Master Lie.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.640
We got him.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.000
What should we do with him?

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.280
Hello, Qin Yu.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.280
Is Wei Wei with you?

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.119
He said he'd come to my place
for dinner tonight,

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.599
but he's still not here.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.800
He's not answering his phone.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.279
Hey. You know I hate...

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.720
this cat poop smell.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.720
This coffee isn't for you to drink.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.120
It's for you to see.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.720
This coffee...

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.440
was Qin Yu's alibi.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.000
I finally found a loophole.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Traitor!

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.520
You traitor!

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.160
Young Master Lie.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.136
Doggo has been with me
for five or six years.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.160
Please let him live.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.000
Then who will pay...

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920
for my dad's life?

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.400
Young Master Lie, don't! No!

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.960
Get his body back
even if he's dead.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.040
Feed him to the dogs.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:00.840
Yi Wei.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.720
Yi Wei.

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440
I'm sorry.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.160
Han Lie and his people
forced me to do it.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.040
How long has it been?

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.560
Half a year.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.360
Don't be scared.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.800
I'll take you to a doctor later.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.120
We'll get you medication.

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.280
Hang in there,
and you'll be fine soon.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760
Don't be scared.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.200
Come on, rest in bed.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400
Don't be afraid.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.800
Dad is here.
