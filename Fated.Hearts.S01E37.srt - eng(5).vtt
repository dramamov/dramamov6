[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.970
[Episode 37]

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.120
If you don't agree to my terms,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.520
I'll die right here today

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.680
along with the child in my womb!

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.950
You're threatening me again!

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.280
I'm just reminding you!

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.759
Fine.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.000
Xia Jingyan!

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.590
Don't.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.650
Alright.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.740
Put the knife down.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.360
Didn't you say

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.870
what's between us is just a deal?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.520
Then I will make

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.850
one final deal with you.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.490
My birthday is coming soon.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.320
Stay with me until my birthday is over,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.910
and I will

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.880
give you a border pass

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.640
and let you all leave.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.910
Is that all?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.280
Good.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.610
Then it's a deal.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:42.590
But first of all,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.450
I need to see my brother tomorrow.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.030
Okay.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.070
I'm going to visit
my ancestral residence tomorrow,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.930
and I'll allow you to see him then.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.750
However,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.079
don't ever think about seeing your brother

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.960
and using that chance to flee away.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.030
This is Jinxiu,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.780
the city under my rule,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.340
and you cannot escape.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.190
Neither do I want to harm Feng Suige.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.990
But if you do something foolish,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.440
you know what I'm capable of.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.040
Xia Jingyan made her

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.000
settle down

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.560
in a palace of the harem.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.040
It's said...

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.840
It's said that Empress Dowager Jing

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.870
has had several fights

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.000
with Xia Jingyan
because of Princess Xiyang.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
As far as I can see,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.280
at least Xia Jingyan is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.810
on Princess Xiyang's side.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.840
She should be safe for now.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.560
I'm going to kill Xia Jingshi.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.470
Feng Suige,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.440
you must stay calm.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.750
I was the one who handed

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.950
my sister over to him.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.000
I've always known

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.030
that Xiyang wouldn't be happy
marrying him.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.120
And I never expected

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.520
him to make Xiyang happy.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.320
My sister cares for him so much.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.120
For him, she was willing to abandon Susha

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.920
and betray her father and brother.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.120
She even threatened to commit suicide

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.980
just to help him out of his misery.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.780
But what about him?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.560
He's ungrateful.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.610
Xia Jingshi doesn't deserve
to be called human.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.750
I will tear him to pieces.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.000
Yes,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.350
Xia Jingshi deserves to die.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.310
But we're in Jinxiu,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.159
not Susha.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.870
Also, we're here

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.310
to rescue Princess Xiyang

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.310
from her predicament,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.830
not to put you in danger.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.530
Calm down first.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.350
We can surely figure out a way.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.920
Xia Jingyan refuses to see you

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.560
and must have

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.310
kept your arrival

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.570
in Jinxiu under wraps.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.610
But don't worry.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.510
I've already told Pei

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.390
to inform Princess Xiyang

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.880
of your rescue plan.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.160
Okay.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.950
Xiyang has led a luxurious life
since childhood.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.610
She's never suffered
such humiliation before.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.630
No one knows her better than I do.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.070
She appears gentle on the surface,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.950
but she's actually quite tough inside.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.510
Having endured all this,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.400
she must be planning
to take revenge for me.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.390
That's why

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.250
you must trust her, too.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.160
If she receives the message,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.920
she'll surely find a way

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.800
to meet with us.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.980
Your Highness.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.220
Your Highness,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.870
the Ministry of Rites told us

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.430
that the Princess

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.600
will come to see you tomorrow

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.920
right at the Yunlai Inn.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.120
Princess Xiyang must have

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.430
received our message already.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.190
Anyway,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.610
let's meet with Xiyang first.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.830
You've waited for so long.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.430
Have a little more patience

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.030
and wait just one more night.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.920
Soon,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.240
you will be able

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.300
to see your sister.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.950
Can't believe you've been through so much.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.750
But Yixiao,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.940
no matter what,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.940
you are still from Jinxiu.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.190
Jinxiu is your home.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.870
If one day

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.070
Susha and Jinxiu go to war again,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.310
how will you choose?

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.520
The former Fu Yixiao is already dead.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.970
It was Feng Suige who kept me alive.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.160
The old Fu Yixiao

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.970
risked her life for Jinxiu

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.210
with nothing to repent of.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.080
Xiyang,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.100
your brother has come to pick you up.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.970
Tomorrow, I will take you home.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.420
So it was all

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.510
my wishful thinking,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.830
my one-sided love.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.950
"Shi'an" is good.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.000
"Shiyou" is better,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.430
suitable for both princes and princesses.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.750
Am I still

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.610
the Princess of Susha I used to be?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.950
Brother,

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.120
am I still your younger sister?

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.430
Yixiao,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.920
do you know

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.120
that I've been scheming all these years

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.920
just for this day?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.360
Xiyang,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
no matter how much you've suffered,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.270
I will

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.360
settle the score for you one by one.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.960
My hands are stained with blood.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.070
I'm no longer who I used to be.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.270
Brother,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.930
I don't deserve to be your sister anymore.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.840
It's just a deal.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.430
I don't care about it either!

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.159
Feng Xiyang,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.000
I have no concern for you at all!

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.790
Yixiao,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.360
wait for me.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.430
Wait until I finish all this,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.850
and I will bring you back to my side.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.780
From now on, I, Fu Yixiao,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.090
will only live for myself.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.310
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.070
The inn is closed.
We're not serving any guests.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.510
And do you understand me?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.360
I told you I'm not here to book any rooms.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.680
I'm looking for someone.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.830
I'm looking for someone about this tall,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.560
usually in red.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560
-Ning Fei.
-Or...

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.830
Yixiao.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.980
Ning Fei, you're here.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.090
Where are Xueying,

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:23.920
Fang, and the others?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.510
How are they?

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.450
Are they all doing well?

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.650
Don't worry, Yixiao.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680
They're all fine.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.640
By the way,

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.240
Xueying asked me to tell you

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.560
that she's tied up right now.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.630
After you wrap things up,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.030
you can go back to see her.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.620
You scared me.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.270
I'm glad they're all doing well.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.480
That puts my mind at ease.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.000
I was planning to settle down first,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.480
then go to Yujing City to help you.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.030
Fortunately, I received your reply

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.390
and learned that you'd come to Shengjing.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.080
So I hurried here

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.030
without delay

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.090
to meet up with you.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.530
Long time no see.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.930
Long time no see.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.030
When you meet your sister later,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.200
remember not to act on impulse.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.390
Talk things through calmly.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.590
Don't make her worry.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.250
Actually,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.150
I haven't been
back to Shengjing for a while.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.030
Ning Fei and I

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.610
will go out for a walk later.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.510
You and your sister haven't

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.550
seen each other for a long time.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.350
You must have a lot to catch up on.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.820
I'll leave you two to talk.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.300
Be careful when you hang out.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.540
Stay safe.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.930
Don't worry.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.120
It's good
that Xiyang can come out to see you.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.020
Make her stay,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.200
and tomorrow morning,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.330
we'll take her away.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.440
All right.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.600
Yixiao,

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.240
do you remember

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.000
when we came to Shengjing once before?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.480
Yes.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.120
His Highness sent the three of us

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.510
to meet someone in Shengjing.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:39.910
Right.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.870
Right on this street,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.510
the three of us

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.910
feasted on a roast lamb together.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.710
It was so good.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.240
I wonder

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.160
if that restaurant is still open here.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200
Steamed buns.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.870
Xiao Weiran?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:14.770
Let's split up and search.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.260
Okay.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:43.850
[Yunlai Inn]

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.230
[Yunlai Inn]

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.460
Your Highness,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.080
please.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:08.000
[Yunlai Inn]

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.980
Your Highness.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.290
Your Highness,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.260
the Prince is waiting for you upstairs.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.790
The Emperor of Jinxiu

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.150
has brought a squad of soldiers with him,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.550
standing guard outside.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.120
Ignore them.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.750
Xiyang.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.440
Brother!

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.720
I thought I would never see you again.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.870
I missed you so much.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.870
I thought I was

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.150
left all alone

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.790
in this world.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.320
Living that way was
more painful than dying.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.660
I know.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.270
I know, Xiyang.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.790
It's all over now.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.570
It's all behind us.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.630
See? I'm standing here

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.090
safe and sound before you.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:02.870
Xiyang.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.480
I failed to well protect you.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.150
No.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.720
It was my fault.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.840
Brother, it was my fault.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.920
I was too headstrong, too foolish.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.290
I didn't listen to you back then.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.910
Everything that happened to me

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.150
was my own doing.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.410
I brought it on myself.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.580
This is the punishment I deserve.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.020
Don't talk nonsense, Xiyang.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.910
Since hearing that terrible news,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.520
I've prayed to heaven every day.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.390
I begged God

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.240
to show mercy and protect you.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.800
I wished it had been me who died instead.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.720
I would rather have

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.800
all the suffering fall upon me.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.600
I don't want you

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.330
to go through any danger again.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.910
It must've been your sincerity and piety

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.120
that moved God.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.810
Throughout my journey,

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.640
I escaped danger at every turn.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.310
See, I'm perfectly fine.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.910
I hate myself so much.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.320
I hate that I made you worry so much.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.200
I hate that I was so bewitched

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.730
that I fell for Xia Jingshi.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.960
I hate that the last time I saw you,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.680
I broke your heart.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.750
Brother,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.390
I've made

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.400
too many foolish mistakes.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.960
Not even my death

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.550
can make up for them.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.960
You tried to make me see Xia Jingshi
for who he was.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.550
But I turned a deaf ear.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.550
I was such a fool that I thought

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.960
I could change him.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.390
But later I realized

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.870
how stupid I was.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.000
But by the time I woke up,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.670
it was already too late.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.860
If I had come to my senses earlier,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.840
I could have come back to you.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.120
At least when you

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.750
went through all those things,

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.620
I could have been by your side.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.750
But all I did was make you angry.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.200
I've never done anything for you.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.440
Listen to me.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.790
I have never blamed you.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.970
When you're with me,

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.000
you can be willful; you can make mistakes;

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.730
you can do anything as you like.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.080
Even if you make all hell break loose,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.480
I've still got your back.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.220
So let bygones

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:07.790
be bygones.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.720
What matters most to me now

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.840
is that you can come back to me

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840

We were like brothers.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.680
Don't force my hand.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.000
So there's finally a day

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.310
when you, Xiao Weiran,
can't bring yourself to act.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.840
You're not worthy of saying

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.030
"brother."

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.860
Do we, the Three Heroes of Jinxiu,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.040
have to turn against each other?

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.730
How dare you mention
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu?

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.330
Weren't you the first to draw your blade?

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.240
What are you doing in Shengjing City?

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.500
None of your business.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.510
Feng Suige is also here, right?

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.370
I guess it's for Princess Xiyang.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.110
Though I don't know

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.570
what you've been through,

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.440
we grew up together,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.270
and with just one look from you,
I can tell

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.930
that you're

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.060
no longer the Ning Fei I once knew.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.880
But I can also tell

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:49.640
that you're still

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.370
the same Xiao Weiran as before,

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.510
still stubbornly

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.510
following your master, the Prince.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.130
You're not

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.110
going to talk me out of this, are you?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.500
You're overthinking.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.240
You're hopeless

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.300
and beyond saving.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.410
I won't waste my breath on you.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.230
Where is Xia Jingshi?

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.870
Tell me where Xia Jingshi is.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.680
What is he plotting?

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.560
I know him well.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.200
Enduring all this
and staying in Shengjing,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.660
he must be up to something.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.070
You shouldn't have

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.400
come to Shengjing City.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.210
But since you're already here,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.780
just stay out of it and don't ask around.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.070
Xiao Weiran, you're implying something.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.600
You're concerned about us.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.530
Don't read too much into it.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.680
I just want to advise you

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.480
to stop going against His Highness.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.160
You've all

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.160
died once before.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.040
Don't court death again.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.000
So in your heart,

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.360
we're always your enemies.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.200
Isn't that the truth?

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.070
You may leave.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.590
Your encounter with us today

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.050
was purely a coincidence.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.640
There's no old bond to reminisce about.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.860
Never mind.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.590
From now on,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.370
we'll split up like strangers.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.770
What else do you want to say?

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.370
It's not safe in Shengjing City.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.830
Leave as soon as possible.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.050
Weiran...

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.620
Let's go.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.120
Hurry back to find Feng Suige.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.580
Something big is about to happen
in Shengjing City.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.110
Alright.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.640
Tong,

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.720
go get Xiyang

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.800
a new pillow.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.220
She prefers soft ones.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.630
Also,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.090
go ask Yu Qi

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.330
for a sachet with turmeric fragrance

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.750
to put under her pillow.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.200
Yes.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.310
Your Highness, please rest assured,

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.440
I'll keep it in mind.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.520
You may go.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.550
Brother,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.270
you actually remember all these details.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.960
Of course.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.310
Just stay here and take it easy.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.440
Don't overthink things.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.300
Just rest well.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.760
Seeing you

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.160
just puts my mind at ease.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.380
And I start to feel a bit tired.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.580
Then get some good rest first.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.790
I'll leave you alone.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.030
[Hidden Dragon Mansion]

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.430
[Hidden Dragon Mansion]

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.940
By order of the Empress Dowager,

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.470
withdraw all the soldiers.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.930
Let's go.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.830
I'll be in charge of security here.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.230
You saw Xiao Weiran?

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.600
He was in a hurry,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.550
definitely still working for Xia Jingshi.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.310
I asked him on purpose

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.750
what Xia Jingshi was planning.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.920
I knew he wouldn't tell me.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.400
I just wanted to see his reaction.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.330
When I asked him,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.550
he unconsciously
avoided eye contact with me.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.400
That's what he usually does when he's

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.460
hiding something.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.400
In this case,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.680
Xia Jingshi

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.410
is indeed planning something.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.630
That's right.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.590
And the Emperor of Jinxiu, Xia Jingyan,

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.070
takes pleasure in torturing Xia Jingshi.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.250
If Xia Jingshi were

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.640
under his control,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.940
he would have Xia Jingshi present

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.880
at his birthday celebration

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.140
just to humiliate him.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.400
Xiao Weiran should be

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.880
by Xia Jingshi's side right now.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.570
But today,

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.250
he appeared on the street.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.440
If I'm not mistaken,

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.960
Xia Jingshi has now

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:53.880
broken loose

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.310
from Xia Jingyan's control.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.890
Your analysis makes sense.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.020
So what do you think

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.030
Xia Jingshi is planning?

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.640
What Xia Jingshi wants most

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.980
is to kill Xia Jingyan.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.000
During the Qianqiu Festival,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.680
Xia Jingyan will be
away from the imperial palace,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.400
making it his perfect chance to strike.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.110
Xiao Weiran told us

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.440
to leave Shengjing quickly.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.070
He must know

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.200
something big is about to happen.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.060
Your Highness!

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.110
I was sending food

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.850
to Princess Xiyang,

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.710
but she's gone.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160
The Princess said

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.110
she had an agreement with that person

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.640
that if she went to meet him,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.920
she could safely leave with you,
Your Highness.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.200
Hey, "that person"?

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.370
Who is that person?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.750
Xia Jingyan.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.380
If Xia Jingshi

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.650
plans to kill Xia Jingyan tonight...

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:32.900
This is bad.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.690
Princess Xiyang is in danger.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.310
I've kept my promise

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.810
to accompany you on your birthday.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.740
If you dare

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.310
break our agreement,

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.010
I will personally lead troops to Susha

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.330
and get you back.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.720
You cannot escape my grasp.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920
I hope you'll also keep your promise

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.170
and let us leave.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.170
I asked you to stay with me,

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:46.910
but I was just joking.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.840
You actually took it seriously.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.880
Do I lack women?

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.000
Do you really think

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.310
I can't bear to part with you?

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.310
I don't care how much is true or fake,

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:55.750
but I, Feng Xiyang,

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.720
always keep

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.920
my promises.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.030
Anyway,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.360
tomorrow is your birthday,

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.030
so I wish you all the best.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.850
Wish me all the best?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.590
I am the emperor.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.410
I get whatever I want.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.260
I can't be happier.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.600
Do I even need your blessing?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.480
You're the ruler of a nation,

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.440
but I feel you've never

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.550
truly been happy.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.830
Who do you think you are?

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.240
How dare you comment on me?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.330
Whether I'm happy or not

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.200
is not for you to judge!

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.110
Fine.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.750
Then I wish from now on,

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.130
you can find joy and happiness.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:04.600
Feng Xiyang,

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.240
give me a smile.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.830
I have never

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.070
seen you smile at me.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.050
Tomorrow I will leave.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.130
And after that,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.840
we will never meet again.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.920
♪ Flying up to the clouds ♪

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.840
♪ Yet the sun is hiding ♪

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:26.520
Don't worry,
