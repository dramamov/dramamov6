[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.990
[Episode 35]

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.530
Your Highness,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.710
the Imperial Guards are here.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.770
Quite a few of them.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.230
It must be the Murong family's doing.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.070
Your Highness,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.350
take Miss Yixiao and leave first.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.220
We'll take care of them.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.980
Stay calm.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.360
They came prepared.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.620
We mustn't act rashly.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.050
They outnumber us.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.280
We can't fight them head-on.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.150
Let's retreat for now.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.760
Follow me.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.690
But...

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.670
This way.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.380
Search!

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.140
Yes!

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.560
Let's go.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.240
Anyone there?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.240
-No.
-No.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.420
General,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.480
no one inside.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.130
General, no one behind the house either.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.620
Come on.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.010
Murong Jie!

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.750
Attack!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.700
Go report to General.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.240
Yes.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.480
This strike...

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.000
Is for Gu Yu!

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.310
This strike

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.780
is for Hound!

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.560
This strike...

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.240
Is for all our fallen brothers!

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.480
Kill!

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.360
Lu Ke.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.159
We can't delay any longer.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.890
Retreat now.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.530
Let's go.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.750
Keep chasing them!

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.110
Yes!

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.960
Let's go!

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.010
Yes!

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.690
Your Highness,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.300
what should we do next?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.560
Go to the Feng Battalion.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.420
Your Highness,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.650
I told you before

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.240
that in the Feng Battalion,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.310
those who refused to submit to Murong Yao

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.830
have all been killed by him.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.480
The Feng Battalion

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.830
is no longer what it used to be.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.630
It would be dangerous for you to go there
like this.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.159
Our men have fought through life and death

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.510
alongside me for so many years.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.270
I don't believe they would betray me.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.920
They only submitted to Murong Yao

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.380
by force of circumstance.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.560
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.830
and never fail the people.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.790
This is the shared belief of all our men.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.430
This will never change.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.180
The Feng Battalion

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.730
will always be the Feng Battalion.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.510
You personally told me back then

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.909
that Feng Suige was dead,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.030
and now you're telling me
he's still alive?

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.880
I killed him with my own hands,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.250
and his body

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.050
was buried by Yao personally.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.040
I cannot figure out

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.040
how he survived.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.510
Could it be that
Ling Feng went to save him?

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.310
It doesn't matter who saved him!

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.560
What matters is that he's still alive

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.490
and he's back!

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.610
He's back for revenge.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.870
Your Majesty,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.680
please calm down.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.350
How can I possibly calm down?

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.920
Back then, you asked me to save your son.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.310
I made him a commandery prince

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.510
and even put the Imperial Guards
under his command.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.720
Your Murong family

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.250
has gained so much already.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.190
But what have you done in return?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.990
A Feng Suige who has lost everything

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.960
is enough to make Your Majesty
panic like this?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.010
If I could kill him once,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.720
I can do it again.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.480
But you've already made me

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.810
trust you wrongly once.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.270
Feng Suige

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.890
hasn't even made a move yet,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.480
and Your Majesty is already

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.270
trying to settle scores with me?

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.870
It hasn't been long
since Feng Pingcheng died,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.920
and you've already forgotten

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.850
how I helped you settle matters

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.080
and put your son

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.480
on the throne?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.040
You're threatening me again.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.170
This isn't a threat.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.560
It's a reminder,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.270
reminding Your Majesty

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.730
not to forget that you said

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.890
the Zhuang and Murong families

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.800
would forever be bound together,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.070
sharing weal and woe.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.870
Then I must also remind you

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.040
that the one

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.570
who branded Feng Suige
with the crime of regicide and patricide

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.870
was you.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.750
You're truly battle-hardened.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.270
You really know
how to keep your composure.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.820
When Feng Suige returns,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.030
the truth will be revealed.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.750
Given the situation,
you're still not worried,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.320
so why should I be?

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.670
Very well.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.030
Now that everything's out in the open,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.120
it'll actually be easier for us
to handle things.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.970
You and I

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.600
no longer have to pretend

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.720
to get along.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.320
The closeness between our two families

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.670
may be a facade,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.840
but the fact that we share weal and woe

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840
is true.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.920
As long as Feng Suige lives,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.900
neither of us will know peace.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.480
If Feng Suige

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.030
wants to turn things around,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.720
he has only two paths to take:

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.660
the first is

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:21.840
to return now

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.630
and regain control of the Feng Battalion.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.830
Your Majesty need not worry about this.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.270
I can take care of it.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.610
But this second path

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.570
concerns His Majesty the Emperor...

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.030
Chengyang won't help him.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.270
I'm his mother.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.980
Your Majesty is so confident.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.960
How many lies

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.450
did you tell His Majesty?

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.550
And how many of those lies did he buy?

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.330
Do you know

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.390
that His Majesty left the palace
last night

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.240
to see Feng Suige?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.120
Did he

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.670
tell you about that?

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.720
What did you say?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.310
Brother.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.130
What else can I do for you?

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.520
Consider it

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.300
as me doing something for Father.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.200
If that's the case,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.000
I need you to do something for me.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.520
Go and reclaim the command of

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.750
the Imperial Guards from

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.810
the Murong family.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.470
All right.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.710
I promise you.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.930
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager
has arrived.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.800
Everyone leave.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.480
Yes.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.030
Mother.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.200
You left the palace last night.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.210
Where did you go?

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.440
I was feeling troubled,

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.630
so I wanted to go out for a walk.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.980
You still dare to lie to me?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.110
I'm the Emperor!

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.070
I go wherever I want!

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.810
So now you realize who you are?

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.390
Now you know you're the Emperor?

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.270
Even if you're the Emperor,

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.870
you'll always be my son!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.380
I'm the one who put you on that throne.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.320
Is this imperial arrogance you're showing

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.910
meant for me?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.420
Then I might as well

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.960
give up this throne.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.020
You wouldn't dare!

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.640
Mother, you came to see me today

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.630
because you already knew

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.480
where I went

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.520
and whom I met.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.490
So why bother asking me?

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.290
Tell me.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.260
What exactly did Feng Suige tell you?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.360
What sweet lies did he use

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.220
to beguile you?

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.610
Brother didn't beguile me.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.190
He told me the truth.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.380
You're still calling him "Brother"?

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.030
You'd rather believe his nonsense

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.260
than believe me?

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.110
I am your mother.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.360
I'm the only family you have left

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.520
in this world!

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.870
That's exactly why I can't let you

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.130
keep making mistakes!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.790
Mother,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.480
please wake up.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.270
Don't stay lost in your delusions,

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.530
and don't keep making the same mistakes.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.480
Listen to yourself.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.810
What nonsense are you even talking about?

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.960
I can still tell

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.000
right from wrong.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:18.840
I have never been

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.060
this clear-headed in my entire life.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.120
Mother,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.600
I beg you.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.240
Please turn back.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.080
You know, Grandfather's last words

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.750
were for me

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.320
to take good care of you.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480
I don't want to see you

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.080
keep making the same mistakes.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.000
I don't want to see you

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.670
become what you are now.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.120
Brother is still alive.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.420
We still have a chance to make amends.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.910
Anyone in this world can say I'm wrong—

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.840
anyone but you!

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.990
Everything I've done

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.200
has been for you.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.320
Mother.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.390
I've made my decision.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.150
I'll issue an edict to strip Murong Yao

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.000
of his position as
the Imperial Guards' Commander-in-Chief.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.400
Even if you try to stop me,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.200
I'll still do it.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.890
I was wrong indeed.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.010
My mistake was

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.880
spoiling you too much.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.770
You're not yet ready to bear
the weight of an emperor.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.520
I was too hasty.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.680
From this moment on,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.390
you'll remain in the palace
to reflect on your mistakes.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.200
You're not to take a single step outside.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.200
I will handle court affairs in your stead,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.480
and matters of state
will be decided by me.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.410
The rest can wait

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.800
until you've truly reflected on
your actions.

[Embrace Simplicity and Uphold Truth]

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.730
Father,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.160
where are you going?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.940
Have you found Feng Suige?

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.760
Feng Suige is now isolated and weak.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.050
If he wants to compete against us,

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:26.270
[Embrace Simplicity and Uphold Truth]

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.240
the Feng Battalion

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.870
is the only power

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.930
he can rely on.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.710
I've decided

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.440
to go to the Feng Battalion
to personally take command.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.910
Father,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.590
I'll go with you.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.520
No need.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.270
You lead the Imperial Guards
and stay in the capital.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.030
As long as the capital stays secure

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.080
and the Feng Battalion
is under my control,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.100
Feng Suige

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.750
will sooner or later

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.550
be trapped like a turtle in a jar.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:50.960
[Embrace Simplicity and Uphold Truth]

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.600
Alright,

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.950
don't worry too much.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.650
Everything is under my control.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.000
Feng Suige

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.750
has no chance of turning the tables.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.120
Alright, Father.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.270
Please be careful.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.900
Let's go!

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.560
Why did you summon me?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.080
You're the first person to ever see me

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.680
draw a bow and shoot an arrow.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.030
What do you think?

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.910
How does my heroic stance

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.440
compare to your brother's?

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.260
You can't even fully draw the bow.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.560
Are you even capable?

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.760
I just don't care for weapon practice.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.330
If I were to lead troops,

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.290
I'd certainly be an emperor on horseback.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.800
My brother taught me

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.860
never to release an empty bow.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.710
It damages both the bow and the shooter.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.510
I know that.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.090
I just forgot for a moment.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.590
Why are you suddenly playing with a bow?

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.720
To help you.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.150
Come on.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.760
Grind the ink for me.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.640
I'll draft an edict.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.570
Xia Jingyan,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.860
what exactly do you want to do?

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.960
I'll proclaim myself

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.760
the Grand Marshal of all forces.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.190
I'll take back all military authority,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.870
including the command over

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.150
Xia Jingshi's Zhennan Army.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.120
Then, I'll personally
lead troops to Susha,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.440
deploy forces at the border
between our two kingdoms,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.550
and force the Murong father and sons
to show themselves.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.480
If you do this...

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.490
Don't worry.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.440
As long as your brother is sensible,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.840
our kingdoms won't go to war.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.390
Your brother is the Emperor of Susha.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:01.960
His authority

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.670
has been undermined
by the Murong father and sons.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.400
I'm sure he also wants to get rid of
the Murong family.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.130
I'll write him a secret letter.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.680
When the time comes,
I'll join forces with him

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.859
to get rid of the Murong father and sons—

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.440
kill two birds with one stone,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.650
a win-win.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.819
I'm afraid your thinking's too simple.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.920
Xia Jingshi

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.720
would never give up his command,
not even in death.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.640
Then I'm really looking forward to seeing

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.040
if he has the guts
to defy my imperial order.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.640
Alright, stop dawdling.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.770
Grind the ink for me.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.960
Who's there? Halt!

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.000
His Highness.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.260
It's His Highness!

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.450
Your Highness.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.010
You're still alive?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.480
It's me.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.540
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.830
Let him in! Quick, open the gate!

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.030
Open the gate! Hurry!

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.280
Feng Suige?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.530
You're not dead?

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.750
It's General.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.480
General is back.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.400
General is back.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.350
General has returned.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.550
-General.
-General.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.140
-General.
-It's General.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.720
This man is a wanted criminal
of the imperial court.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.570
Generals,

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.200
seize him at once!

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.310
Are you trying to rebel?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.850
Feng Suige committed
regicide and patricide!

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.880
His crimes are unforgivable!

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.540
Arrest him at once!

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.710
He's right.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.710
Right now,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.200
I'm a fugitive wanted by the court.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.770
But I never committed
regicide or patricide.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.310
I came back today

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.170
to clear my name.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.760
Brothers of the Feng Battalion!

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.480
I don't want to
make things difficult for you.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.340
If any of you want to win merit
by capturing me today,

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.930
don't hesitate and step forward.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.460
Did you all hear that?

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.060
He just admitted it himself!

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.540
Seize him now!

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.840
What are you waiting for?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.930
Take him down!

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.060
Today,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.180
whoever captures Feng Suige

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.360
will be promoted 3 ranks

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.960
and rewarded with 100 taels of gold!

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.210
If anyone dares to harbor him,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.680
they'll be treated as accomplices!

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.680
The crime of rebellion

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.240
will lead to the execution of
your entire clan!

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.640
-Think about your family!
-Your Highness!

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.000
You...

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.510
Cao.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.880
What happened to your leg?

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.590
It's nothing.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.140
Those bastards broke it.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.120
I

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.230
can't follow Your Highness
to battle anymore,

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.760
but I can still cook for you.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.860
Your Highness,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.950
you won't mind having me around, will you?

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.210
How could I ever mind?

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.810
Where is Hong Shan?

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.210
That poor fellow

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.570
has gone ahead of us.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.240
He asked me to wait for
Your Highness's return.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.620
It's all my fault.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.020
I came back too late.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.900
Honor heaven above,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.930
respect the earth below!

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.880
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.510
and never fail the people!

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:22.700
You...

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.080
Honor heaven above,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.910
respect the earth below!

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.830
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.490
and never fail the people!

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.270
Honor heaven above,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.010
respect the earth below!

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.880
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.460
and never fail the people!

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.200
All of you,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.610
shut up!

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.530
Get up!

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.690
Get up right now!

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.830
You...

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.160
All of you!

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.310
The government pays your salaries!

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.550
You're not Feng Suige's private army!

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.510
Let me tell you,

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.430
if you arrest Feng Suige now,

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.460
it's not too late!

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:01.400
The Prince of Han

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.930
is on his way here right now!

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.960
If you dare to delay any longer,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.790
once His Highness arrives,

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.510
he'll surely make you

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.970
die alongside Feng Suige!

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.980
What are you doing?

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.310
-Beat him to death!
-Beat him to death!

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.310
Beat him to death!

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.920
-Beat him!
-Beat him!

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.580
Although I, Feng Suige, am a prince,

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.240
I've been displaced since childhood.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.920
It wasn't until
I founded the Feng Battalion

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.450
that I finally found a home.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.960
You're all my family.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.420
Guys.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.480
Over the years,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.270
we've fought off foreign enemies together,

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.350
risking our lives

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.880
for Susha,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.160
never showing

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.020
the slightest bit of negligence.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.890
Yet now,

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.960
I've been accused of

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.540
regicide and patricide.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.000
It was me who led you all

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.530
down this path of no return.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.590
I'm sorry to have made you suffer!

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.190
Not at all!

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:06.830
We don't mind.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.550
We don't mind at all!

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.640
Not at all!

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.700
If anyone wants to leave now,

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.750
I, Feng Suige, will not force them
to stay.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.960
I won't stop you,
nor will I hold any grudge.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.560
Whatever I do from here on out

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.760
will have nothing to do with
any of you present!

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.240
Is there anyone who wishes to leave?

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.070
No one!

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.240
Now is not the time to play hero.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.800
It's not too late to quit!

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.360
Our fates

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.070
rise and fall together!

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.810
Live together in joy,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.810
die together in hardship!

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.510
Guys.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.030
Today, I also want to

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.490
introduce someone to you.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.710
Her name is Fu Yixiao.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.920
She was once Jinxiu's

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.980
Red-Clad General.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.280
But now, she has

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.000
nothing to do with Jinxiu anymore.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.680
My life

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.080
was saved by her.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.420
She not only saved my life.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.500
When I was falling into the abyss,

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.410
she pulled me back;

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.320
when I was sinking into hell,

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.960
she awakened me.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.070
Without Fu Yixiao,

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.400
there wouldn't be the Feng Suige

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.690
you see today!

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.030
Guys.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.570
What I want to say is,

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.820
from now on,

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.000
I'll stand by Fu Yixiao
through thick and thin,

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.930
never abandoning each other.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.380
From this day forward,

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.350
she's one of our Feng Battalion.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.790
She

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.510
is our family!

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.790
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.790
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.000
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.110
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.240
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.510
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.590
Fu Yixiao!

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.120
Guys!

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.920
Murong Zhong will be here any moment.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.550
Let's get our defenses in place

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.070
and prepare to face the enemy!

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.830
Yes!

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.240
An enemy is an enemy.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.200
Next time, don't put on
that sanctimonious act,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.400
pretending to persuade me to turn back.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.920
You just think killing me

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.780
would interfere with your plans.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.360
Xia Jingshi.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.790
No one in this world

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.720
understands what you're thinking

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.510
right now better than I do.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.160
Xia Jingshi!

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.500
I'll kill you!

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.120
Your Highness, Her Majesty has arrived.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.800
Your Highness.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.490
Your Highness, what's wrong?

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.790
Is the poison acting up again?

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.920
Help me deal with Her Majesty
for a bit.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.600
Greetings

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.440
to you, Mother.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.450
What's wrong with you?

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.750
Your Majesty.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.550
His Highness is suffering from
the effects of the poison.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.590
Didn't I give you

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.990
the antidote last month?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.700
Did you not take it on time?

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.750
His Highness did take the antidote,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.080
but these past few days,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.510
His Highness has been feeling restless,

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.200
utterly exhausted in body and mind.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.880
It's probably because

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.960
his body is too weak

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.480
that the poison has flared up again.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.570
Prince of Zhennan.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.640
You're not hiding

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.170
something from me, are you?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.650
Mother,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.880
I'm not.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.030
I don't want to make you worry, Mother.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.570
It's nothing serious.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.240
Since you've taken the antidote on time,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.700
your life's not in danger.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.410
Get up and speak.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.550
Yes.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.230
If you can't endure this little pain,

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.070
how will you command the army

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.470
in my stead in the future?

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.290
You speak wisely, Mother.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.750
I heard His Majesty took you

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.200
to that wretched woman,

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.760
and Feng Xiyang almost killed you,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.160
so I came to check on you.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.510
Why didn't you tell me

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.350
about such a serious matter?

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.950
I didn't want to make you worry, Mother,

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.600
so I kept quiet about it.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.350
Your health

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.950
is deteriorating day by day.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.600
This Rongyang Palace
is gloomy and confined,

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.280
not suitable for long stays.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.310
I think

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.650
you should move out of the palace.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.880
Mother, do you mean

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.760
you want me to leave the palace?

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.090
His Majesty didn't kill you this time,

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.070
but there's no guarantee

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.730
he won't be serious next time.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:25.680
Now in this palace,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.880
even I find it difficult to protect you.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.620
You'd better go outside
and hide for a while.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.100
I've arranged a residence in the city.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440
Go and stay there.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.390
Don't forget,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.970
you were the one who reminded me

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.720
the Qianqiu Festival is approaching.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.130
You should start preparing early.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.270
Thank you for your kindness, Mother.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.160
I understand.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.670
And I know what to do.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.060
Don't disappoint me again this time.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.780
Your Highness!

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.000
The antidote.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.120
Give me the antidote.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.680
Yes.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.110
I said before

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.070
that these antidotes must not be touched

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.670
until the grand plan begins.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.960
And now,

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.150
the grand plan is about to begin.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.640
Feng Suige...

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.550
Uncle Murong.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.220
We meet again.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.770
So you really aren't dead.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.200
With my great vengeance unavenged,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.880
how would I dare to die first?

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.510
There's no rush.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.210
I still have things to ask you.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.630
There's nothing left to say.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.000
Kill him!

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.980
You once saved my life.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.690
I regarded you as my closest elder.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.650
Why did you kill my father?

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.380
Why did you want me dead as well?

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.720
If you hadn't,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.820
then Yao would have had to die.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.970
I begged you,

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.510
but you turned me down.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.290
You wouldn't help me save Yao.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.170
I carried thorny branches on my back,

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.460
kowtowing with every step into the palace,

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.480
to beg your father

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.860
to spare his life.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.070
But he still wouldn't let Yao go.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.710
I couldn't just watch

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:23.230
my son die.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.820
Yao and I

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.000
had no way out.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.400
This was all

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.360
forced upon us by you and your father.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.580
If it hadn't been for Murong Yao's

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.800
treason and collusion with the enemy,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.230
so many Susha soldiers

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.400
wouldn't have died unjustly

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.860
in the Battle of Pingling!

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.360
He betrayed me.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.100
I could spare his life,

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.110
but how am I supposed to answer to

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.170
all our brothers who died?

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.340
Talking about

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.070
brotherhood in front of me?

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.490
In this life,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.050
how many battles

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.420
have Yao and I

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.760
fought for

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.910
you and your father's kingdom?

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.300
I was even like a brother to His Majesty.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.360
It's fair to say I've spent my entire life

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.960
laying down my life for him!

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:37.580
Look at me!

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.920
I've done far more for Susha

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.320
than you ever have.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.040
All that talk of patriotism

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.070
is nothing

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.550
but a joke to me now!

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:50.280
In my life,

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.330
I've never sought fame

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.850
or power.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.000
All I wanted

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.290
was to live peacefully

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.710
with my children and grandchildren.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.550
Is that too much to ask?

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.150
Is that a crime?

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:16.960
Your father

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.760
deserved to die,

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.920
and so do you.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.590
I must save Yao.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.290
I must save Yao!

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.760
I must save Yao.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.150
Suige,

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.910
please spare Yao.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.850
Killing you

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.660
was my idea.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.330
He was forced into it.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.230
You may pulverize my bones

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.880
and scatter my ashes.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.720
I only beg you

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.840
to spare Yao...

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.290
Uncle Murong.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.720
His Majesty never intended

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.330
to harm you and Yao.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.170
That day,

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.030
it was Empress Zhuang

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.960
who killed His Majesty.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.400
The Murong family has brought chaos
to our kingdom

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.730
and committed treason.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:06.800
Their crimes are grave,

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.660
intolerable to heaven and earth.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.800
All soldiers, heed my command!

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.590
Yes!

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.850
March with me into Yujing City

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.990
to avenge His Majesty!

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.150
Yes!

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.720
My mistake

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.700
was spoiling you too much.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.900
You're not yet ready to bear
the weight of an emperor.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.210
I was too hasty.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.650
From this moment on,

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.760
you'll remain in the palace
to reflect on your mistakes.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.020
You're not to take a single step outside.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:47.470
Spare my mother.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.140
I'll take her away from Yujing

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.880
to live out our remaining days.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.710
Her sins

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.880
are also my sins.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.330
I'll pay for them in her place.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:59.360
Someone!

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.400
Summon the Keeper of the Imperial Seal

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.920
to bring the Imperial Seal.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.250
I need to draft an edict.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.110
I'm speaking to you.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.170
Can't you hear me?

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.130
Are you defying my orders?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.800
Your Majesty.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:13.990
Her Majesty...

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.520
The Empress Dowager's words are orders,

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.960
and mine aren't?

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.070
I am the Emperor.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.760
My words—

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.360
every single word I utter
is an imperial edict!

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.530
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.800
I will say this one last time.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.070
Summon the Keeper of the Imperial Seal
to bring the Imperial Seal.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.480
I need to draft an edict!

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.930
If these ears of yours cannot hear,

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.110
I'll cut them off for you!

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.700
Who let the Prince of Zhennan go?

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.030
Was it you?

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.820
Spare me, Your Majesty!

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.570
I know nothing about it!

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.080
He glanced at you.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.110
So it must be you.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.360
It wasn't me, Your Majesty.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.480
Spare me, Your Majesty!

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.800
It was me who let him go.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
All of you, leave!

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.400
Mother, what's that supposed to mean?

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.930
I should be asking you.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.670
You intend to reclaim all military power.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.330
What's that supposed to mean?

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.150
Mother, you truly have eyes and ears
everywhere.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.400
My edict just reached the Secretariat,

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.150
and you're already alarmed.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.590
Do you realize

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:48.850
how much trouble

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.670
issuing this imperial edict will cause?

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.510
Which of those veteran generals,
so used to wielding their own troops,

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.970
will let it slide quietly?

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.280
Even if the sky fell on Jinxiu,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.850
it should be me bearing the weight.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.690
I understand now.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:03.360
In your heart,

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.480
the one who holds up

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.070
the sky over Jinxiu has never been me,

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:08.600
but Xia Jingshi. Am I right?

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.840
He did hold it up.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.550
If it weren't for him,

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.550
Susha's army

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.070
would have reached here long ago!

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.530
Even without Xia Jingshi,
there's still me!

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.590
Look at

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.920
what you've become now.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.360
How exactly

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:20.840
did that wretched Feng Xiyang

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.880
bewitch you?

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.280
Don't call her wretched!

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:26.230
You think I'm

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.630
bewitched by her beauty?

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.000
I've seen all kinds of women, okay?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.590
Then why do you protect her so fiercely?

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.440
Because she gave me

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.000
something I've never had before.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.800
When she was most helpless,

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.060
she asked for my help. Do you understand?

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.710
Of course you wouldn't understand.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:42.500
In your eyes,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.280
I'm nothing but someone who

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.010
wastes his life in debauchery.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.250
I only ascended to this throne

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.710
because I am your son.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.440
Have you ever for one day

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.300
cared about me?

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.880
Everyone in the world thinks

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.720
I'm useless.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.000
After a while,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.530
I started to believe it too.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.660
I once wanted to be a good emperor,

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.490
but no one believed in me,

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.660
and no one had expectations of me.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.020
Then what's the point of working so hard?

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.500
You've always been
the true ruler of Jinxiu.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.570
So I could only give up on myself.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.240
But Feng Xiyang doesn't think like that.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.690
She thinks I have value.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.030
She's never

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.070
tried to bewitch me.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:30.480
She's never even

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.710
treated me kindly.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.630
But when she was most desperate

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:34.510
and most helpless,

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.510
she asked me to help her get revenge.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.330
Do you find me ridiculous

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.580
or pitiful?

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.980
But I don't think so.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:49.590
I like this feeling

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:50.760
of being needed.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.590
Because I have never

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.720
been needed before.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.550
All of this...

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.400
All of this was because of you,

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.190
Mother!
