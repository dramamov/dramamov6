00:36.320 --> 00:41.280
THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ETA WAS FOUNDED
IN 1958 DURING THE FRANCO REGIME.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.920
AT THE TIME
OF THE DICTATOR'S DEATH IN 1975,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.200
ETA HAD KILLED 44 PEOPLE IN SPAIN,

00:53.680 --> 00:56.280
AMONG THEM, ADMIRAL CARRERO BLANCO,

00:56.360 --> 00:59.320
PRIME MINISTER
AND THE DICTATOR'S RIGHT-HAND MAN.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.160
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF DEMOCRACY IN SPAIN,

01:09.240 --> 01:12.560
A FACTION OF THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
SURRENDERED THEIR WEAPONS.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.240
We believe we've played a key role
in our people's history

01:16.320 --> 01:18.520
and achieved considerable levels
of autonomy,

01:18.600 --> 01:21.040
which we will still fight for
in nonviolent ways.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.480
Armed combat and ETA
have served their purpose.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.480
BUT ANOTHER FACTION
DECIDED TO CONTINUE KILLING.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.440
Yesterday's surprise attack
in Zaragoza may be the work

01:30.520 --> 01:34.600
of an ETA cell,
dispatched directly from Southern France.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.600
IN THE '80S,
ETA SPREAD TERROR IN THE STREETS,

01:38.680 --> 01:41.720
KILLING OVER 400 PEOPLE.

01:41.800 --> 01:47.240
Moreno Arguilea was shot twice
in the head, killing him instantly.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.960
Dramatic scenes of panic unfolded
in the city center.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.760
Several children, six women,
and four men were among the victims.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.000
IN THE '90S, THE SPANISH CIVIL GUARD

01:58.080 --> 02:01.800
DEVISED AN OPERATION
TO WIPE OUT THE TERRORIST GROUP.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.680
THE OPERATION LASTED FOR 12 YEARS.

02:10.760 --> 02:14.040
HUNDREDS OF SPANISH
AND FRENCH OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED.

02:16.920 --> 02:21.280
THIS COULD BE ONE OF THEIR STORIES.

03:51.360 --> 03:55.720
I'm an artist from Paris

03:55.800 --> 04:00.200
I'm an artist from Paris

04:00.280 --> 04:02.360
I play very well!

04:02.440 --> 04:04.720
We do too!

04:04.800 --> 04:07.360
I play the drums!

04:09.200 --> 04:11.400
TOWN HALL

04:11.480 --> 04:15.360
JANUARY 23, 1995

04:17.560 --> 04:21.320
I'm an artist from Paris

04:21.400 --> 04:26.320
I'm an artist from Paris

04:26.400 --> 04:28.320
I play very well!

04:28.400 --> 04:30.600
We do too!

04:30.680 --> 04:33.040
I play the violin

05:00.720 --> 05:04.320
COEXISTENCE
SOLIDARITY

06:07.320 --> 06:12.040
An ETA gunman
has shot and killed Gregorio Ordóñez,

06:12.120 --> 06:14.040
leader of Guipúzcoa's Partido Popular

06:14.120 --> 06:18.600
and the man who was likely to become
the next mayor of San Sebastián.

06:18.680 --> 06:23.160
The incident has sparked distress
in the Basque Country and beyond.

06:29.440 --> 06:34.440
Thousands of citizens gathered in Bilbao
this evening for a demonstration

06:34.520 --> 06:37.080
in protest of ETA's brutality

06:37.160 --> 06:40.000
and to mourn
the loss of a brave politician

06:40.080 --> 06:43.160
who had the democratic support…

06:52.840 --> 06:55.120
He came to pick up the car keys at eight.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.200
A white Renault 6.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.520
License plate San Sebastián 5401 AJ.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
Sir.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.880
-I gave him the keys.
-Don't blame yourself.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.600
None of us, including you,
could have imagined they'd kill him.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.960
There are hard times ahead.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.200
Take extra precautions.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.560
A YEAR AND A HALF EARLIER…

08:21.000 --> 08:23.680
-Hello?
-Meet me at the bar tomorrow at ten.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.960
Officer Amaya Mateos Ginés.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.080
Currently serving in the Seville command.

08:32.160 --> 08:35.120
She lost both her parents at age 16.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.440
Studied English and French.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.720
Knowledge of Basque, level two.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.400
She is solitary, methodical, and orderly.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.240
She shows signs of independent thinking
and a desire for adventure.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.360
She's requested to serve
in the Basque Country twice.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.680
When asked about her motivations
for joining the Civil Guard,

08:56.760 --> 08:59.320
she answered with the verses
of an Irish poet.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.040
"Nor law, nor duty bade me fight"

09:04.560 --> 09:09.280
"Nor public men, nor cheering crowds"

09:10.480 --> 09:14.120
"A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds"

09:16.240 --> 09:19.120
"I balanced all, brought all to mind"

09:20.440 --> 09:25.360
"The years to come seemed waste of breath
A waste of breath the years behind"

09:26.320 --> 09:29.760
"In balance with this life, this death"

09:32.480 --> 09:35.000
Only four people
will know your true identity.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.920
The prime minister,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.680
the minister of the interior,
the head of the Civil Guard, and myself.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.760
You will no longer be Amaya Mateos Ginés.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.760
We will train you to become
Amaia López Elósegui,

09:46.840 --> 09:48.120
an ikastola schoolteacher

09:48.200 --> 09:50.760
and Basque National
Liberation Movement sympathizer.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.640
I must remind you,
this is a highly dangerous mission.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.920
If they find out about you,
they will kill you.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.880
You will be on your own.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.400
Take a few days to decide.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.800
No, there's no need.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.400
All right.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.080
Where are we headed, sir?

10:14.160 --> 10:15.760
To meet your mother.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.840
Take good care of her, please.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.200
This is your legend.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.240
Your new identity.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.160
Make it your own.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.720
Your life depends on it.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.120
Aramaio.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.960
The ikastola, the Basque school,
has approved your application.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.840
This is Begoña Landaburu,
the principal of the ikastola.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.360
We arrested her husband five years ago.
He was part of the Donosti cell.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.200
They have two kids.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.480
Based on what we know, she oversees
legal ETA cells in Guipúzcoa.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.480
-Amaia?
-Yes.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.640
Don't let her friendly demeanor fool you.

11:23.240 --> 11:27.680
She's smart. She knows what she's doing.
We've never been able to charge her.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.040
We'll use Italian songs
as a code to communicate with you.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.240
Play them when you want to contact us.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.960
She attended a religious school
in Brussels.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.720
Then she went on
to study English and French.

12:06.800 --> 12:11.240
Here are her enrollment records.
She never finished her degree, though.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.760
Until now, she's supported herself
by tutoring and doing translations.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.080
She translated the Irish poet Yeats
into Spanish.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.320
It must've been good.
They published her work in this magazine.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.360
How is she paying
for her mother's nursing home?

12:30.440 --> 12:31.960
Her mother's widow's pension

12:32.040 --> 12:35.240
and the money left
from selling her parents' apartment.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.600
She's been attending
local Herri Batasuna meetings lately.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.120
SPEECHES

13:28.560 --> 13:31.080
-Ane, are you all by yourself?
-Yeah.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.080
Don't worry. I'll keep you company.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.320
Your mom will be here soon.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.920
-Ane!
-There's your mom.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.600
-Sweetie!
-Ama!

13:43.480 --> 13:45.760
Wow. Your Basque is getting better.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.320
-No way.
-You'll be speaking fluently soon.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.760
I'm still embarrassed to speak in public.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.520
Where did you learn Basque?

13:55.040 --> 13:56.320
My ama taught me.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.080
Is she still alive?

13:58.880 --> 13:59.880
Yeah.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.200
If you can even call it that.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.600
She can't talk,
and she doesn't recognize anyone.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.720
Not even me.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.840
I'm sorry.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.880
Hey, do you have plans later on today?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.920
I was going to head home,
and I have to go see my ama later.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.680
Well, I'm meeting some friends
for a drink.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.840
You should come.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.920
I need the lieutenant colonel.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.840
What happened?

15:22.520 --> 15:23.760
She's made contact.

15:26.560 --> 15:30.880
She's taken me under her wing
but hasn't proposed anything yet.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.240
She has been subtly asking me
a lot about my past, though.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.800
She won't make a move
until she's certain you're trustworthy.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.440
Avoid anything that could compromise you.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.800
We've set up a visit
with your fiancé at a discreet hotel.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.760
Take the weekend off.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.280
Thank you, sir.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.840
Be very careful.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.800
Nicolas…

16:53.160 --> 16:55.160
SPAIN-FRANCE BORDER CROSSING

16:55.240 --> 16:58.560
One thing that's become clear

16:58.640 --> 17:02.720
is that the Spanish government can take
40 of their Civil Guards dying every year.

17:02.800 --> 17:08.440
So we should change our approach
and hit them where it hurts the most.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.440
Our enemies aren't just
the nameless Civil Guards.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.200
They are also those who use violence

17:14.280 --> 17:18.560
against our people
from positions of complete safety.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.280
We should choose our targets carefully

17:23.200 --> 17:26.520
and attack the heart of the state.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.200
Politicians, judges,

17:32.400 --> 17:33.600
journalists…

17:35.520 --> 17:39.520
From now on,
we'll distribute the suffering.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.320
Arrieta will cross the border.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.360
We'll get the Donosti cell running again.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.120
-Goodbye, sir.
-Bye.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.920
ONWARD

18:16.000 --> 18:18.800
INDEPENDENCE
SOCIALISM

18:18.880 --> 18:21.000
ETA, the people are with you!

18:30.360 --> 18:33.200
RETURN BASQUE DETAINEES TO EUSKAL HERRIA

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
That's Joseba.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.960
Euskal Herria is under military
and police occupation,

18:41.000 --> 18:45.440
pushing us from a position of resistance
to an offensive stance,

18:46.120 --> 18:51.040
where street violence
reflects the reality of our situation.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.320
We've been enduring this violence
here in our country for years.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.080
We can name names.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.200
It's time for others
to start suffering too.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.960
The enemies of Euskal Herria

19:05.040 --> 19:08.680
have names too.

19:10.360 --> 19:17.320
The judges, journalists, councillors,
and politicians all have names.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.800
Let's go.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.160
Free Euskadi!

19:21.240 --> 19:24.600
ETA, the people are with you!

20:05.480 --> 20:08.120
-They're following us.
-I know.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.960
A woman in green and two men.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.000
Let's go to my place.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.840
-What's this place called?
-Aramaio.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.640
Aramaio, that's it.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.160
Where my amona and ama are from.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.400
Why did you come back from Belgium?

20:49.480 --> 20:52.360
Partly for my mother.
She hated living there.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.520
But also for me.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.320
I broke off a long relationship.
There was nothing left there for me.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.720
But mostly, I came
because I wanted to help.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.920
I'm embarrassed to say this,

21:06.680 --> 21:09.840
since you've been fighting
for years and your husband's in jail.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.760
But I'm not like you, Begoña.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.760
-I've always been a coward.
-In this war, everyone does what they can.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.520
Everything helps,
no matter how small it may seem.

21:23.160 --> 21:24.160
I don't know.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.320
I belong to ETA.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.000
I joined ten years ago.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.000
I'd like to propose something.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.360
I'm Amaia.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.240
What do you want me to call you?

22:20.160 --> 22:21.480
I don't speak Basque.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.840
My room?

22:28.160 --> 22:29.160
Over there.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.840
I need you to buy these things.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.840
Memorize it.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.640
-When does the garbage truck come by?
-Any minute now.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.320
When the truck passes, throw it inside.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.280
-Got it?
-Yeah.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.240
Cooking's not your strong suit.

23:42.840 --> 23:43.840
Nope.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.840
Thanks.

25:11.560 --> 25:15.960
I NEED HELP WITH THE GARBAGE BAGS

25:47.480 --> 25:48.680
OUT OF ORDER

26:27.920 --> 26:32.280
Someone will come pick these keys up.
They're for the white Renault out front.

28:17.320 --> 28:22.160
SOUTH OF FRANCE
JANUARY 1996

29:04.200 --> 29:09.200
ETA was responsible for the abduction
of a Burgos prison officer last Wednesday.

29:09.280 --> 29:14.240
An anonymous source
told the newspaper Egin

29:14.320 --> 29:18.440
that the terrorist group
was behind the abduction.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.240
In a brief statement given last night

29:21.320 --> 29:25.120
to the Basque newspaper Egin,
the terrorist organization ETA

29:25.200 --> 29:29.040
claimed responsibility
for abducting the Burgos prison officer

29:29.120 --> 29:32.160
and confirmed that more news
will follow in the coming days.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.960
Logroño penitentiary center staff

29:42.040 --> 29:44.120
hold a 15-minute vigil every Wednesday…

29:44.200 --> 29:45.160
Is something wrong?

29:45.240 --> 29:47.240
…at the prison gate.

29:47.320 --> 29:51.480
Countless representatives
from groups and institutions

29:51.560 --> 29:54.280
have come by to show their supp--

29:55.480 --> 30:00.640
I know you don't like talking about it,
but when will you come back home?

30:02.560 --> 30:05.560
You said it'd be a few months,
but it's been over two years.

30:06.760 --> 30:07.920
Yeah, I know.

30:09.480 --> 30:10.480
But…

30:14.800 --> 30:16.520
let's not talk about that now.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.600
Tell me.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.760
How's everything at the office?

30:25.280 --> 30:26.680
Too good.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.880
So good, I can't keep up,

30:32.160 --> 30:33.640
so I got a business partner.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.200
A woman.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.480
A woman?

30:44.640 --> 30:45.960
What do you mean?

30:54.400 --> 30:57.400
-Amaya, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.120
What's the matter?

31:03.440 --> 31:04.440
I don't know.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.200
I'm sorry.

31:16.240 --> 31:20.360
Whatever it is you're doing,
you've been here too long.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.520
FEBRUARY 6, 1996

32:00.160 --> 32:03.560
They were approached by two young men,
near 13 San Martín Street.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.400
After threatening the victim
and his son with guns,

32:06.480 --> 32:09.920
they shot the well-known socialist leader
in the head.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.840
LAW SCHOOL, MADRID
FEBRUARY 14, 1996

32:25.920 --> 32:27.920
EX-PRESIDENT, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

32:28.000 --> 32:31.400
UAM's law school has suspended classes.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.640
It's the university's way of mourning

32:33.720 --> 32:39.120
the history of law professor
Francisco Tomás y Valiente.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.440
Enough is enough!

33:05.440 --> 33:06.440
Come in.

33:08.760 --> 33:09.920
In the kitchen.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.240
Here's the phone you asked for.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.760
-Is it for you?
-No, for Isuntza.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.120
He's handling Ortega Lara.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.800
I'm considering giving Amaia
more responsibilities.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.200
You made sure?

33:35.800 --> 33:36.800
Yeah.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.120
I'll look into her.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.400
Get someone to watch her in the meantime.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.360
What for?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.480
She's too perfect.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.240
I heard you lived in Brussels.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.200
Yeah.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.360
I lived there for a while too.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.280
I didn't like it.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.640
Well, I did.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.080
-Where'd you live?
-Molenbeek.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.040
-Evariste Pierron Street.
-I know the place.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.560
I lived nearby.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.120
There was a bistro there
called Le Mariton, right?

34:38.280 --> 34:39.280
No.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.400
Le Mariton isn't a bistro.
It's a restaurant.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.880
It's downtown and really expensive.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.360
I'll see you soon.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.960
The card matches this number.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.800
-Did you verify it?
-Yes.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.560
Activate a wiretapping team
24 hours a day.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.560
And talk to Judge Le Vert.

37:38.640 --> 37:41.000
Have her authorize the wiretap in France.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.440
Yes, sir.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.880
The lambs' water is on the way.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.800
The lambs' water is on the way.

38:36.520 --> 38:39.400
It's Isuntza.
They're delivering explosives.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.840
Order traffic officers to be on alert.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.200
Have them stop any suspicious vans.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.560
And contact the French Judicial Police.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.520
We're arresting Isuntza.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.240
This is for us.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.600
Bol, 5k.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.440
Five million pesetas is a lot of money.
And ETA usually works with francs.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.000
This is an operation in Spain.
It might be the Ortega Lara abduction.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.400
Investigate everything connected to Bol.

39:37.080 --> 39:40.360
First names, last names,
aliases, companies… Everything.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.560
-Hello?
-Begoña Landaburu?

39:49.320 --> 39:52.240
-This is she.
-Joseba is dead.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.080
What?

39:55.160 --> 39:58.680
Your husband hanged himself in prison.
I'm sorry.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.480
-Hello.
-Hi.

40:16.560 --> 40:18.680
I brought some things for Begoña.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.920
She's inside.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:31.960 --> 40:32.800
How are you?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.680
Fine. I'm fine.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.280
The kids did some drawings for you.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.680
Want a cigarette?

40:57.120 --> 41:01.080
Will you help me organize his clothes?
I want to send them to the prisons.

41:01.920 --> 41:02.920
Sure.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.160
He's the txakurra pig
who arrested and tortured Joseba.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.960
Lieutenant Colonel Julio Castro Sánchez.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.920
A real son of a bitch.

41:32.720 --> 41:35.480
I know I could be arrested any day now.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.640
They will torture me.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.960
They did the same to Joseba.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.240
I'll resist as much as I can.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.560
But going to prison?

41:46.360 --> 41:50.480
Spending 20 years alone,
away from my kids… that terrifies me.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.920
-Don't think about that now.
-Lately, it's all I think about.

41:57.160 --> 42:00.880
After what happened,
you could ask for some time to get away.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.000
And focus on your kids.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.960
I'm not quitting now.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.080
I've been in this fight since I was 15.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.320
I have no choice but to carry on.

42:17.280 --> 42:20.120
If you're an abertzale, a patriot,
born in Euskal Herria,

42:20.200 --> 42:23.080
you're on probation from day one.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.040
Sooner or later,
you'll end up behind bars.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.200
Or in the cemetery.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.840
She has a picture of you in her room.

42:39.880 --> 42:43.040
And of General Galindo
and some others at the Intxaurrondo base.

42:46.360 --> 42:50.200
-You didn't tell me you arrested him.
-I didn't think it was necessary.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.960
I interrogated him too.

42:55.680 --> 42:56.680
Right.

43:02.960 --> 43:06.720
She asked me to join a cell
to gather intel on potential targets.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.600
Military personnel, Civil Guards,
and police to attack in the coming months.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.920
We'll provide you with information
on the targets.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.000
Before I forget,

43:17.080 --> 43:20.800
thanks to the intel you gave us
on Arrieta's phone,

43:20.880 --> 43:23.760
we intercepted a van carrying explosives
bound for Madrid.

43:23.840 --> 43:28.160
We arrested Isuntza
and seized important documents.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.840
Sir, looks like we've found "Bol."

43:37.520 --> 43:40.600
His name is Josu Uribetxeberria Bolinaga.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.080
He's a member of a support cell.

43:43.160 --> 43:46.200
He's renting an industrial unit
in Mondragón.

43:48.120 --> 43:51.840
The Guipúzcoa Civil Guard freed
José Antonio Ortega Lara in Mondragón.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.520
The prison official walked out

43:54.600 --> 43:58.720
of the zulo hideout,
where he'd been kept for 532 days.

43:58.800 --> 44:02.000
With this operation,
and four suspected ETA members arrested,

44:02.080 --> 44:06.440
the Civil Guard has put an end
to the longest abduction in ETA's history.

44:06.520 --> 44:09.000
This is where José Antonio Ortega Lara

44:09.080 --> 44:13.920
was found early this morning
by Civil Guard officers.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.840
Talleres Jalgi is an industrial unit
of approximately 7,500 square feet,

44:19.920 --> 44:22.600
located in the San Andrés neighborhood
of Mondragón.

44:22.680 --> 44:27.480
Inside, they built a zulo
with a complex hydraulic access system.

44:27.560 --> 44:34.360
The police weren't able to reach
Ortega Lara's cell until 6:30 a.m.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.520
Promise you'll think about it?

45:12.920 --> 45:14.040
Promise.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.560
Come on.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.720
Get going.
You're going to miss your train.

45:36.680 --> 45:42.040
CATERING BUDGET
WEDDING SERVICE

46:04.440 --> 46:07.440
He's a sergeant
who volunteered for the mission.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.240
He's special forces.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.600
He's prepared.

46:11.120 --> 46:15.080
Here are the schedules, itineraries,
and some photos you supposedly took.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.560
If this goes well,
you could move up the ranks.

46:34.880 --> 46:35.880
Sir.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.720
What's your plan for me?

46:47.880 --> 46:48.880
To go to France.

46:50.360 --> 46:52.840
We don't know how yet,
but when the time comes,

46:52.920 --> 46:56.040
we'll make you
an ETA member seeking refuge there.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.800
What would my mission in France be?

46:58.880 --> 47:02.440
To get close to the leadership
and assist us in locating ETA's zulos.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.600
That's where they keep their weapons
and explosives.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.320
We've been searching for years.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.000
Two or three more years, at least.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.040
Yes. At least.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.520
-Begoña, what are you doing here?
-I need to talk to you.

47:38.400 --> 47:39.400
Sure.

47:39.480 --> 47:40.840
Not here.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.360
Why did you bring me here?

48:29.120 --> 48:30.960
You were seen with a guy at a hotel.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.080
That was Antonio.

48:37.920 --> 48:40.280
-I told you about him, Begoña.
-No, you didn't.

48:40.360 --> 48:41.800
-I did.
-Who is he?

48:41.880 --> 48:43.400
My boyfriend from Brussels.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.800
He wants us to get married.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.560
-Why didn't you take him to your place?
-I don't know.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.800
He thought a hotel would be more romantic.

48:52.200 --> 48:55.760
Why am I being interrogated like this?
My private life--

48:55.840 --> 48:59.680
You don't have a private life now, Amaia.
You belong to ETA.

49:08.040 --> 49:09.440
I have what you asked for.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.120
Show me.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.680
He's a Civil Guard sergeant.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.440
Regular as clockwork.

49:37.440 --> 49:41.000
He drives to his base
every morning at 7:50.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.040
His street connects to an avenue.

49:55.400 --> 50:00.000
That sergeant will be our next target.
Andoni will be responsible for that cell.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.080
You'll be the driver.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.160
Ever fired a weapon?

50:10.200 --> 50:11.240
No.

50:31.680 --> 50:33.400
It's easier than it looks.

52:36.880 --> 52:38.200
It all went wrong.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.200
The txakurra saw my face.

52:43.760 --> 52:45.520
Don't worry about that now.

52:46.240 --> 52:49.600
According to the news,
he's fighting for his life.

52:56.840 --> 52:57.840
Take it away.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.040
What?

53:02.560 --> 53:04.560
Take it. I don't want to use it anymore.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.720
It saved your life.

53:13.480 --> 53:14.480
I know.

53:18.280 --> 53:20.000
But I don't want to use it again.

53:29.560 --> 53:30.640
Thanks.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.360
The sergeant's out of the woods.

53:35.560 --> 53:39.320
We told the media he was
in critical condition to protect you.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.840
-Sorry. I thought the sergeant knew--
-He did.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.840
But he went too far and disobeyed orders.

53:47.080 --> 53:49.280
He was trying too hard
to make it convincing.

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400
Sure.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.000
You know, it was the first time
I shot someone.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.080
And I didn't shoot a criminal.

54:04.360 --> 54:05.960
I shot a fellow officer.

54:06.040 --> 54:09.440
You can't think like that.
Look on the bright side.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.520
Nobody will question you now.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.080
I want to go back home.

55:01.720 --> 55:05.160
I think this is my last chance
to be a normal person again.

55:10.520 --> 55:14.120
I'm really sorry,
sir, but I've reached my limit.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.000
You don't need to explain yourself.

55:17.920 --> 55:19.440
Your work was exemplary.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.000
Can I help you with anything?

55:23.760 --> 55:25.280
A new assignment, maybe?

55:26.720 --> 55:27.720
No.

55:29.720 --> 55:31.320
I think I'm quitting the force.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.840
Have you thought about
what you'll tell Begoña?

55:39.760 --> 55:40.760
Yeah.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.360
Something like the truth.

56:18.080 --> 56:21.720
I don't know.
Maybe she wasn't cut out for this.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.400
Maybe.

56:24.120 --> 56:27.080
But she's definitely not cut out
to be a wife and mother.

56:29.920 --> 56:34.120
CARMONA, SEVILLE

57:06.880 --> 57:09.680
Good evening. All signs point
to ETA having abducted

57:09.760 --> 57:12.600
the Partido Popular's city councillor
for Ermua, Biscay,

57:12.680 --> 57:14.360
Miguel Ángel Blanco Garrido.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.880
Egin received an anonymous death threat
against the councillor.

57:17.960 --> 57:22.640
They said they'd act within 48 hours,
by Saturday at 4:00 in the afternoon,

57:22.720 --> 57:27.080
if the Ministry of the Interior
does not group ETA inmates

57:27.160 --> 57:28.880
in Basque Country prisons.

57:28.960 --> 57:29.960
He's going to die.

57:30.040 --> 57:32.440
Mayor Oreja
has informed the prime minister…

57:32.520 --> 57:33.560
Take this dress off.

57:33.640 --> 57:36.080
Hundreds of Miguel Ángel's neighbors

57:36.160 --> 57:40.400
took part in
an almost impromptu silent protest

57:40.480 --> 57:42.840
through the streets of Ermua

57:42.920 --> 57:45.880
just hours after hearing the news.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.440
MIGUEL, WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU

57:59.440 --> 58:02.440
But politicians were not the ones
taking center stage today.

58:02.520 --> 58:06.400
Our society played the leading role,
as millions of people

58:06.480 --> 58:10.240
throughout Spain rose up
to face a terrifying reality

58:10.320 --> 58:12.920
that we have all grown too tired of.

58:24.680 --> 58:28.680
And here we are,
waiting for the fateful deadline

58:28.760 --> 58:31.400
set by ETA, waiting until 4:00 p.m.

58:32.560 --> 58:36.600
And, of course,
we join the family in hoping

58:36.680 --> 58:40.240
for Miguel Ángel's quick return
back here, to his home.

59:45.640 --> 59:50.160
Enough is enough!

59:57.400 --> 59:58.920
SAN SEBASTIÁN, JULY 12

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.240
MAN FOUND IN LASARTE
WITH TWO GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO THE HEAD

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.720
What do we have on the zulos?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.240
Not much.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.680
We believe there are five
in small towns across the south of France.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.240
After all these years,
we're still in the dark.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.200
They're ETA's best-kept secret.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.520
You'll have to contact Begoña.
We'll arrest Andoni once you do.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.840
We'll take advantage of this
to speed up your escape to France.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.480
There, we'll be relying on you.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.840
You'll be our eyes.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.280
But first, you have to regain
Begoña's trust.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.880
It's a good time to go back.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.040
They're increasingly on their own.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.880
So?

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.000
I heard what was happening
and how we were being harassed.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.000
My whole world came crashing down.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.840
I felt ridiculous walking around Brussels,
holding Antonio's hand.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.840
Was what we did with the councillor right?

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.720
No.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.640
I think it was wrong.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.560
And it'll cost us,
politically speaking.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.000
But what's done is done.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.920
Andoni was arrested this morning.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.560
-What if he talks?
-He will.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.360
You need to go to France
before you're identified.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.960
I'll go with you.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.240
TWO YEARS LATER
SOUTH OF FRANCE

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.880
A van packed with 20 kilos of dynamite

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.920
exploded in front of Fernando Buesa,
the leader of Álava's socialist party

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.080
and Basque Parliament party spokesperson.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:14.000
He was with Jorge Díez Elorza,
bodyguard and Ertzaintza officer…

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.160
José Luis López de Lacalle
was murdered at 9:45 this morning

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.640
in front of his house
in Andoain, Guipúzcoa.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.440
COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBER (1938-2000)

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.200
He was shot four times.
Twice in the head and twice in the chest.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.280
López de Lacalle, a founding member
of Foro de Ermua, was 63 years old,

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.480
married, and a father of two.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.720
Former socialist minister Ernest Lluch
has been murdered

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.440
tonight at the garage at his residence
with two gunshots to the head.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.400
The attack took place
just before 10:00 p.m.,

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.160
although his body remained hidden
between some cars…

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.680
TXORI (BIRD) ZULO
ETA'S SAFE AND DOCUMENT ARCHIVE

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.480
They call him "Dagoki."
I've been his driver this past week.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.480
His real name is Juan Cruz Maiza Artola.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.560
We found his fingerprint
four years ago during a search.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.080
It seems he manages the zulos.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.240
We're on the right track.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.440
Okay.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.720
I was waiting here.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.560
The car Dagoki came out of was
a red Nissan, plate number 5522 SO 33.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.400
-I don't think they came from far away.
-Why?

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.880
It was pouring
just minutes before they arrived.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.800
But the car was dry.
It wasn't out in the rain.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.640
I picked Dagoki up, and we left.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.360
The two nearest towns
are Mouguerre and Ayherre.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.480
One of the zulos could be in this area.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.520
And another thing.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.800
I've located another area
where a different zulo could be.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.560
I took Dagoki here yesterday.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.240
He got into a gray Ford,
license plate 2776 LA 33.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.920
A blue Mercedes van followed them
as soon as they left.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.520
License plate 4563 MA 33.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.880
They went south,

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.000
towards Urrugne.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.840
The zulo must be around here.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.520
URRUGNE ZULO

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.880
EXPLOSIVES, GRENADES, GRENADE LAUNCHERS

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.640
Nice work.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.240
Thanks, sir.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.320
It's my daughter's birthday.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.920
Did you cut your hair?

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.360
It looks good.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.480
Are you seeing somebody?

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.360
No.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.120
Tomorrow, pick up a car at this address.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.080
It's a red Citroën.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.640
The keys will be in the ignition.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.280
Take it to Dax at 4:00 p.m.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.440
Bring it to the parking lot
in front of the bridge.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.760
A lady will be waiting for you there.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:28.160
Give her the car
and come back on your own.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.040
-Her.
-Fabianne Tapia.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.520
The partner of ETA's number one,
Iñaki de Rentería.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.280
They have a daughter together.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.240
She's been off our radar for a while.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.520
We'll watch her house.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.440
Rentería's bound to show up.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.400
We'll arrest him as soon as he does.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.680
Your mother passed away.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.960
Want me to stay?

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840
No.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.280
What do we know?

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.320
It seems like they knew his every move.
They've known about the house for a while.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.400
Apparently, they moved in really fast.
Iñaki barely had time to destroy anything.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.640
They seized boxes full of documents.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.320
It doesn't look good.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.520
The house was very secure.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.400
Tell Begoña I need to speak with her.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.600
But have her come with you,
not the driver.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.800
Thanks to the documents
seized from Rentería,

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.360
we now know of the existence
of a zulo that they call

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.800
"Txernobil."

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.360
It's probably the most important one.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.280
We're also monitoring
the area you pointed out

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.920
between Saint-Pierre-d'Irube
and Mouguerre,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.240
which is where we assume
the Txori zulo is located.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.760
I checked out the latest arrests.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:33.520
We used to be ahead of the Civil Guard,
but they're now several steps ahead of us.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.160
Not because there's been
a breach of secrecy

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.800
or because the French police
are working with the txakurras.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.400
There's another reason.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.000
We have a mole.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:50.360
Don’t trust anyone until we identify them,
even if they're close to you.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.800
I think I know who it is.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.920
-You don't like it?
-I'm not hungry.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.440
What's wrong?

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.800
We're dropping like flies
and the Civil Guard is closing in.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.160
They're too close at times.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.960
What made you join ETA?

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.200
Why are you asking me this now?

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.160
It's weird you left everything behind
and came here.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:43.040
My reasons were different from yours,
but that doesn't make them any less valid.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.120
You'll always have your kids.
I left everything behind.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.960
What we left behind doesn't matter.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.640
I want to know why you did it.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.160
Maybe because I've been on my own
since I was a kid.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.200
And for once, I wanted to belong.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.880
To not be alone
while doing something that really matters.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.040
And this? This matters to me.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.240
You're driving him today.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.760
Let's go.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:25.560
Turn left.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.080
Stop here.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.880
-What are you doing?
-He's a txakurra mole.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.280
Arms behind your seat.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.640
-Okay.
-Now, damn it!

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.120
Calm down. Okay.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.560
Here.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.480
Keep watch.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.200
Give me that.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280
Give it here.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.600
I'm an air force captain.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.560
The border is just a few miles away.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.920
If you take me to Spain,
I swear, anything you've done won't--

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.360
Start the engine.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.080
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name…

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.760
My name's Miguel Luque.
Please tell my family that… Please…

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.600
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.960
Pull something like that again,
and I'll kill you.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.680
You got that? I will kill you.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.640
I can assure you,
we didn't know about him.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.040
How'd they find him out?

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.840
The captain, may he rest in peace,
and the secret service were sloppy.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.000
And the fight against ETA,
as you know, doesn't allow for mistakes.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.320
Tomorrow we'll arrest Begoña
and members of the logistics network.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.840
I thought you'd like to know.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.240
She was going to see her kids
this weekend.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.440
She'll see them in jail now.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.920
It's been over a year since I saw my kids.
Let's see how this goes.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.120
At 9:00 p.m., here.

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.800
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.120
Shit. I see txakurras everywhere.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.200
I know you want to see your kids.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:17.120
But if you think we're being followed,
maybe we should turn around.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.440
No. It'll be fine.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.240
Bye.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.840
Bye.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.240
It's a bit out of the way.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.480
But after Begoña's arrest,
it's the safest place.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.920
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.600
You can go up. Second door on the left.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:08.760
The informant we killed couldn't be
behind the majority of the arrests.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.000
He'd been in France for less than a year.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.320
We've had a mole inside for years.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.520
I'm going to need to see Old Txiki.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.120
It's been too long, Txiki.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.000
Over ten years.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.280
Yeah, it's been a long time.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.800
Here. The names of inmates

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.600
who need to tell us how they were arrested

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.840
and who they were in contact with.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.520
Someone's playing us.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.400
And has been for a long time.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.040
TXERNOBIL ZULO
500 KG OF EXPLOSIVES

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.000
4,000 ELECTRIC DETONATORS
50 UZIS

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.960
33 GRENADE LAUNCHERS
300 RIFLES AND SUBMACHINE GUNS

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.440
2 GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:56.120
The zulo is here.
The light came on just over a mile away.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.560
It's a secluded farmhouse.

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:05.320
We've located the five zulos, sir.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.800
Do you have kids?

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.560
Two. A son and a daughter.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.320
My son just graduated from the academy.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.920
My daughter's a nurse,
but we butt heads a lot.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.360
-Why's that?
-She doesn't like that I'm a Civil Guard.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.640
She thinks we're still
under Franco’s influence.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.560
I used to get angry at my father too.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.760
I realized, I've lived more years
without my parents than with them.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.000
I don't remember their voices.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.880
Sometimes I can't remember their faces.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.880
Who chose the songs we use to communicate?

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.640
My wife did.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.040
Thank her for me.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.240
She died three years ago.

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.440
I'm sorry.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.920
Hello, Txiki.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.440
-Is that all of them?
-All the prisons.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.320
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.520
YOU KNOW WHO IT IS.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.960
"The years to come seemed waste of breath"

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:25.480
"A waste of breath the years behind
In balance with this life, this death"

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.080
-So?
-I don't know what to say, Marisol.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.200
It's been ages since I read poetry
translated into Spanish.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.760
But some of these words and verses

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.440
seem old-fashioned to me,
like "caudillo" for "public men."

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.640
Or how she translates,

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.880
"A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds."

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.160
It feels like the work of an academic
or an older poet.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.880
We've got to investigate these three.
It's one of them.

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.240
Who should I start with?

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:14.680
This one.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.440
Let's go. I'll show you the way.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.800
Stop here.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.360
Mind if I smoke?

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.400
I'd rather you didn't.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.480
I heard you're a translator.
You translated English poets into Spanish.

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.720
An Irish poet, mostly.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.600
Yeats.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.240
-Heard of him?
-No.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.920
But I read the poem you translated.

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.560
I can't remember the title, though.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.080
"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death."

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:34.440
Right.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.760
That one.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.560
I'm sure that, in this valley,
no one was born or buried

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.440
under the name Edurne Elósegui.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:39.200
I know the name of everyone
who was born and died here.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.120
My son.

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.480
That funeral home in San Sebastián
gave you the wrong information.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.920
Yes?

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.400
Thank you, sir.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.840
I was just told that I'm accused
in three torture cases in Intxaurrondo.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.800
INTXAURRONDO BASE

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:40.200
9 CONVICTIONS FOR TORTURE
5 FOR KIDNAPPING AND 5 FOR MURDER

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.440
On March 22nd,

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:53.920
the funeral home where I work
picked up Edurne Elósegui's body.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.720
We were meant to take it
to the Aramaio cemetery.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.440
But there's no record of a funeral there.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:05.760
So I looked into it,
and none of our drivers transferred a body

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:10.400
from the Aldakonea nursing home to Aramaio
or anywhere in the Basque Country.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.560
They took it to the South.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.840
To Cazalla de la Sierra.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:17.600
In Seville.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:29.040
We've heard that they're really on edge.
They know they have a mole.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:33.760
You're in danger.
Leadership has decided to end the mission.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.800
What?

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:39.800
Carrying on is dangerous,
and all five zulos have been located.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.640
We'll speed up the operation
to dismantle them. It'll start on the 3rd.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.680
You'll have to leave the same day
to avoid raising suspicions.

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.920
Tune in to Radio Nacional's news bulletin
at 9:00 every morning.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.360
If we believe you're in danger,
they'll play the song "Parole, parole."

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.240
When this is all over,
what are you planning to do?

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.320
I'd like to meet new people.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.560
People who aren't like us.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.480
We have the mole. It's the driver.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.800
OPERATION SANCTUARY

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.680
Commander. It's time.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.760
And that wraps up our news bulletin,
just after 9:05 a.m.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.400
It's proving to be
a particularly bad Sunday for traffic.

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:06.280
The police and National Traffic Authority
have put special measures in place

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.960
to manage the flow of traffic
this morning.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.440
More on that shortly.

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.080
But first, let's take a look
at today's weather.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.120
We're joined by Reyes Eguilior from
the National Meteorological Institute.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.720
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:22.160
Skies will be mostly clear today,

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:25.680
and temperatures
are expected to remain hot…

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
You need to hear this conversation.

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:44.800
We have the mole. It's the driver.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.920
Call Radio Nacional.
Have them play the song. Now.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:28.400
Hello?

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.440
It's the driver.

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.400
Okay.

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.160
We were too late.

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.160
Maybe she didn't hear the song.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.080
Talk to the gendarmerie.
Get us the local station.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:54.720
…those coming from areas farther
from the circuit should use the M-607,

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.840
or alternatively, take the detour via…

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.720
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.800
-Is there any coffee left?
-No. I just finished it.

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.920
Do you have the song
"Parole, parole" by Mina?

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.800
There's a French version.

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.960
Yes, French.

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.760
Look for it. Please.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.800
Dagoki has a job for you.

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.280
I'll finish my cigarette first.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.600
Is it a long trip?

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.000
Kind of.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.360
I need to use the bathroom.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:56.800
OPERATION SANCTUARY
WAS THE BIGGEST BLOW DEALT TO ETA.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.760
WITH THEIR ZULOS DESTROYED
AND LEADERSHIP DISMANTLED,

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.560
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE TERRORIST GROUP FELL.

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:14.360
SEVEN YEARS LATER, IN OCTOBER OF 2011,
ETA ANNOUNCED A PERMANENT CEASEFIRE.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.320
SHE WALKS IN DARKNESS

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:46.800
