(Zhou)
Jian Cheng said

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.190
that Meng Tang asked me to tell you

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.550
to contact her as soon as possible,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.630
and make it clear.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.810
Otherwise, dragging it out

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.590
will affect you
starting a new relationship.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.960
And also,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.240
stop hiding out in the clubhouse.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.310
It's bad for business.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.550
Zhou,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.720
you're doing this on purpose.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.800
You're being way too petty.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.310
We are brothers.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.430
If I'm miserable,

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.730
you don't want to be fine either.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.690
(Meng Tang)
Tomorrow,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.100
let's meet up.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.700
(You've withdrawn a message.)

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.500
(Meng Tang)

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.560
No need to withdraw it.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.430
I already read it.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.310
See you tomorrow.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.430
Do you even like Meng Tang?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.840
To me, Meng Tang

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.560
is a pretty strange presence.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.430
She often stirs me up inside,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.280
but never to the point of heartbreak.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560
So,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.310
I probably don't love her?

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.570
Then give her a clean break

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240
and free yourself too.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.160
Why do you ask me to meet here?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.130
I want to grab lunch with you.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.800
And also

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.640
with Mi Shan.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.840
- I'm thinking
- Meng Tang,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.140
I just saw a kid selling flowers.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.790
(Lin Ye, Meng Tang's junior)
He looked so pitiful.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.270
So I bought them all.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.270
Coincidentally, I run into you here.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.830
That's quite a coincidence, huh?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.430
Yeah, it's coincidental.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.830
(A peacock spreading tail feathers!)

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.950
Can I invite you to dinner?

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.950
You just said

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.510
you're having lunch with Mi Shan,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.560
right?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.470
Sure, I'm free.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.710
I won't eat with Mi Shan.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.060
Just you and me.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.970
After all, I'm your fiancé.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.560
We haven't had a meal together in ages.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.860
Fiancé?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.460
No way.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.390
You're really Meng Tang's fiancé?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.000
Yeah.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.270
Even it's true,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.880
you two will split sooner or later.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.310
I'm around her every day,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.720
but I've never seen you call her,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.490
nor have I seen you pick her up
from work.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.830
What's the use

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.100
of having a fiancé like you?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.400
That hurts.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.690
I'll handle it myself.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.000
You deserve it.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.810
Look at what he's done to me.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.190
Have I ever been treated
like this before?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.070
Meng Tang.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.730
I just feel that guy isn't good enough,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.300
strutting around like a pretty peacock.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.330
And he talks way too much.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.920
He's not right for you.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.100
I'm worried you'll get fooled.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.470
Qin Zhuo.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.000
I…

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.540
(Mi Shan)

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.820
(Mi Shan)

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.980
(Zhang)

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.560
Speak.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.750
I lost track of Su Yun.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.510
Wait there for me.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.350
I'm on my way.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:09.790
Thanks,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.200
Qin Zhuo.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.820
You helped me lose the last point.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.840
My guy just called me.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.040
He said Su Yun seemed
to be tailing Jian Cheng.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.160
But he lost her.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.630
I called Su Yun and her agent.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.470
No one answered.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.390
Su Yun?

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.510
That woman's name is Jian Cheng.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.070
She's the daughter of Changsheng Group.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.310
Jian Cheng.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.310
Glad you're OK.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.000
You're married?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.560
Mm.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.630
From the look on your face,

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.750
you two must be doing pretty well.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.870
Yeah, we are.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.720
Actually,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.390
I came back this time for someone.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.080
(I'm just the wife of a president.)

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.870
(Even I know how to protect my privacy.)

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.990
(You're a big name
in the entertainment industry.)

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.880
(And yet you openly share secrets
with others.)

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.960
Someone

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.960
I thought I'd marry.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.150
Over these years,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.080
many people guessed
I had a financial backer.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.440
I never responded to any of it.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.750
Because they weren't wrong.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.080
Behind me,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.630
there has always been a man.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.630
(Am I even supposed to hear this?)

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.230
Actually,

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.840
as a public figure like you,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.680
it's better not

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.150
to reveal too much of your own secrets.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.200
We made a promise.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.390
I'd step away from the industry at 30

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.230
and

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.200
he'd wait for me until I turn 30.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.120
This time I came back,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.660
just to celebrate his birthday with him.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.360
I thought the day had finally come.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.510
But guess what?

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.390
He had a huge surprise for me.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.240
He got married.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.750
He actually got married.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.230
Today,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.080
thanks for listening to me

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.480
and for giving me a ride back.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.590
It's nothing.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.190
Actually,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.970
I've been following that movie
you and Director Mei are working on.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.200
I really hope

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.890
you have a great collaboration
this time.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.350
Mm.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.550
Alright, I'll head back now.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.120
Good thing it wasn't a scammer.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.700
(Calls from Zhou Tingyan)

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.390
Oops, I got carried away by gossip.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.110
- Hey, pretty.
- What are you trying to do?

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.000
What are you doing?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.910
Come hang out with me.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.320
Stay back.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.080
- No, stay back.
- Come on.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.370
Let go of me.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.550
I'm sorry.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.340
Stop hitting me.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.910
Is this the police?

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.080
I'm at Unit 2, Building 17,
Fortune Community.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.270
There's someone harassing me.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.120
Jian Cheng.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.110
Stop hitting.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.200
Keep the wound away from water.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.080
Get plenty of rest.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.270
I truly apologize.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.750
It's me who kept talking with you.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.510
If I'd gone back and left earlier,

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.870
this thing wouldn't have happened.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.160
It's not your fault.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.610
Well,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.510
I'm really fine.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.840
By the way,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.600
about what I told you today,

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.890
can you keep it just between us?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.080
Yeah.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.260
Don't mention it to your family either.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.870
I'm worried...

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.120
I get it.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.390
It's your personal matter.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.630
I promise I won't tell anyone.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.040
I'm sorry.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.150
Alright, alright.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.020
I'm really sorry.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.360
It's OK.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.200
Alright, alright.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.000
(I definitely can't reveal the secret,)

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.510
(but I must tell Zhou Tingyan)

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.940
(about the grievance I've suffered.)

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.590
Hello?

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.360
Zhou Tingyan,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.150
someone's giving me trouble.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.150
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.990
Yeah.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.510
Su Yun specially took leave
to come back this time.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.000
(Zhang Zhen, Su Yun's agent)
Director Mei was already unhappy.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.600
Now she's hurt her face too.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.870
Miss Jian,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.610
I'm not being unreasonable here.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.270
Now she ruined her face

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.230
to save you.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.750
If Director Mei really gets upset,

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.270
she may lose this chance.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.000
Luckily, it's not a deep injury.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
To put it bluntly,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.000
if it left a scar,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.670
you'd be ending her career.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.480
That's enough.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.200
This isn't Jian Cheng's fault.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.910
No one wanted this to happen.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.750
Stop talking.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.390
You're always like this,

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.870
always standing for others.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.270
What about that injury on your face?

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.890
How will you explain it to Director Mei?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
As for Director Mei,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.290
I might be able to handle it.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.840
Just focus on getting better.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.270
Don't worry about anything else.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.380
Who do you think you are?

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.200
You're still relying on...

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.320
Jian Cheng.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.750
Zhou Tingyan.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.510
What took you so long?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.840
Sorry.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.960
I'm late.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.000
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.950
My hand hurts.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.780
