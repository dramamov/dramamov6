(Whose Secret)

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.359
I've investigated Jiang Mingfeng's case.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.660
He lied to the men
and bullied the women.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.119
It was true that he was corrupt.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.159
I revealed my findings

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.799
and people are changing their opinions.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.880
The public now believes

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.600
that you did a good deed

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.079
by killing Jiang Mingfeng.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.439
I only hope Madam

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.280
is not hurt.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.799
I'll help you keep an eye on her.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.880
Gu Xihe.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.359
If you like a girl,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.359
how should you confess to her?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.519
Are you going to...

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.959
She hasn't admitted it.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.799
Before you succeed in
pursuing your Madam,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.599
I suggest you give her more flowers

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.000
to make a girl happy.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:27.959
You may leave.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.640
Miss Lu.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.239
Miss Lu.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.879
You have flowers from men again.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:47.040
- I envy you.
- They are pretty.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.760
The flowers are so pretty.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.400
We are so envious.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.200
I'm sure these are from
the Chief Inspector, Mr. Li again.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.000
A bouquet a day

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
without fail.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.159
He is such a handsome, rich,

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.400
and loving man.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.599
Miss Lan,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.480
all of us have been living
in Paramount for so long.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.840
When are you introducing men to us?

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:10.960
That's right.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400
All of you should work hard.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.680
Go.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.599
It's time to go on stage.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.000
In that case, have both of you
confirmed your relationship?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.159
Are you his girlfriend now?

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.800
We haven't

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.960
confirmed our relationship yet.

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.400
If you haven't
confirmed your relationship,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.199
why would he

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.000
pick you up from work
and send you flowers every day?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.159
In my opinion,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.992
this man is already infatuated with you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.199
and can't stop loving you.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.159
Miss Lan,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.319
I...

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.400
I don't know how he feels about me.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.000
If he hasn't confessed to you,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.960
you can confess to him first.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.960
You must do everything you can

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.759
to tie a good man like him down
as soon as possible.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.400
Miss Lan,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.759
no woman

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.759
would confess to a man
since ancient times.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.159
You're still going to be stubborn?

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.759
You are

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.639
a woman of the new generation.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.080
You are also the leader of Paramount.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.479
You are good enough for him.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.840
The process and method don't matter.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.199
What matters most is the result.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.879
Trust my words.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:32.719
(Li Motong.)

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.879
(Will we)

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.800
(have a future?)

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.360
(Miss Lu,)

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.280
(I hope you get all your wishes)

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.120
(and all roads are smooth for you.)

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.599
(I hope the flowers bring joy)

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.400
(and leave you in a good mood.)

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.080
Li Motong broke the Wujian rules again.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.759
As the Supreme Priest,

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.400
aren't you going to do something?

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.400
Those in Wujian
cannot fall in love with a human.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.159
As the Lord of Wujian,

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.599
he neglected the rules of Wujian

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.800
and fell in love with Lu Huayan again.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.520
Lu Huayan is just
the vessel of Mei pearl.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.319
She doesn't deserve love.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.080
Stop them from falling in love.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.800
The Mei pearl

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.399
must return to Wujian.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.879
Our goals are the same.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.920
Let them doubt

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:23.680
and kill each other.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.000
Do you have an idea?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.519
Do you still remember
what happened back then?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.319
If we let the sealed past
reappear in the Mortal Realm

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.120
and show Lu Huayan the truth,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.800
do you think they will still be in love?

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.040
They will only
go for each other's throats.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.079
The Mei pearl
will always return to Wujian.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.360
(You gave me so many flowers.)

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.199
(I must also give you)

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.560
(some reward of love)

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.820
Darling, why are you also thinking about

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.319
giving me red roses?

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.480
I...

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.399
I figured there were too few colours

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.399
in your nursery

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.360
so I thought about

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.079
adding more colours to it.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.079
It seems like we have the same idea.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.720
Show me.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.800
Why can't you be more careful?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.319
It's a minor wound.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.120
Don't use Wujian force on it.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920
It's no minor wound.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.120
That's enough.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.879
Let me teach you how to care for roses.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.720
When watering roses,

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.480
the water must be just right.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480
Not more or less.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.199
That is how you can keep them alive.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.399
Understand?

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.319
You, try it.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.959
Is it like this?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.480
Didn't I tell you just now?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.000
You must

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.480
water the roses slowly.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.519
Madam, you are
very patient with these roses.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.279
I feel like becoming a rose, too.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.759
You are also a flower.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.120
However,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.480
you are a Pretty Guy Flower.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.920
Pretty Guy Flower?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.040
Why do I feel

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.920
more like a Cannibal Flower?

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.920
I'm not done watering the roses.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.460
- Good!
- Good!

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:39.360
Huayan,
you haven't returned for so long.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:42.399
You don't even come home
now that you're in love.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.879
Miss Lu, you're back.

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.120
You don't know
how bad Paramount's business was

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.480
during the few days that you left.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.680
That's right, Miss Lu.

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.680
I envy you for finding such a good man.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:55.639
That's enough.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.480
Go on stage quickly.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.680
It's time to perform.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.439
I'll be waiting for you.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:02.319
Huayan, I want to thank you

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.279
for still being willing to support me.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.439
What are you saying, Miss Lan?

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.240
This is my home.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.040
I haven't returned for so long.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.680
Don't worry.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.360
I'll perform well

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.680
in the upcoming performance.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:16.240
Well said. Do your makeup well.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.839
I'll be waiting for you.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.279
Darling.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.519
Darling.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:45.600
Boss.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.759
What are you doing?

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.440
What are you hiding?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.879
Why are you here so late at night?

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:52.799
I'm looking for some data.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:53.960
It's so late.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.159
Are you going out?

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.440
I'm going to pick Yan up.

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.879
I can go and pick up Miss Lu.

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:00.960
You?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.159
That's right.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.200
What should I do, then?

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.960
Do you have business with Miss Lu?

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:09.200
I'm prepared.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.159
I'm going to tell her honestly

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.960
about everything that happened.

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:15.039
About Wujian?

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.399
Yes.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.360
Her sister died because of Chi pearl.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.559
If Miss Lu blames this

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.600
on you,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.240
it'll affect your relationship.

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:29.720
Why not turn a blind eye to it

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.639
and fool her?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.320
But if I'm going to marry her,

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:36.399
I don't think
there's a need to hide things.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.279
If she blames me

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.039
because of the past,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.360
I'll accept it.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.159
Faith will move mountains.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.039
I believe

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:48.840
she will forgive me one day.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.799
What is this?

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:55.919
A birthday gift for Miss Lu?

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.200
Can't you see

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.000
that it's a proposal ring?

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.919
Is it because it's not big enough?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.919
It's big.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:09.440
It's big enough.

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.600
I believe you will succeed.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.799
Do your best.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.799
I'm busy so I'll be leaving first.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.720
Who are you?

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.039
I am the Supreme Priest of Wujian,

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:29.240
You Zimei.

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:30.600
Miss You,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.480
can I help you with anything?

00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:36.399
Your fate with Li Motong
is like a moth drawn to a flame.

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:39.399
You knew you'd be in trouble
once you touch the embers

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.440
yet you still throw yourself to him

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:43.879
for a moment of brilliance.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.320
In the end,

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.840
your life will just end hastily.

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:51.679
Miss You,

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:53.720
I love him a lot.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.399
He also loves me a lot.

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:57.919
We will never end up as you said.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.600
For Li Motong,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.039
you are the ember.

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:04.840
As for him,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.440
he is the foolish moth.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.200
What do you mean?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.879
I have Li Motong's sealed memory.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.879
Take a look.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.799
For millennia,

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:29.120
Li Motong has always loved a woman

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:30.279
called Lanyue.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.840
(Watching the sky by day
and the clouds by night.)

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.919
(I miss you when I walk.)

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.799
(I miss you when I sit.)

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:38.759
(Lanyue,)

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:42.039
(I'm willing to be with you
in every lifetime.)

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.799
They understood and loved each other

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.600
until Lanyue died.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.600
Lanyue.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.440
Lanyue, wake up.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.240
I beg you.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.440
I beg you.

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:56.240
Please, wake up! I beg you!

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.440
She is the person
Li Motong misses day and night.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.759
You are

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:05.759
just a substitute.

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:07.639
Impossible.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.000
He loves me.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.600
It's impossible
for me to be just a substitute.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.039
I'm not a substitute.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.480
This is impossible.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.840
It's impossible for me
to be a substitute.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.679
Miss Lu,

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:28.240
I think

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.399
you don't want
to be a substitute too, right?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.480
I'm not the substitute!

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.279
It's impossible for me
to be a substitute!

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.440
It's impossible for me
to be a substitute!

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.440
I must ask him.

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:01.600
I must ask him.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.799
I need to ask him.
