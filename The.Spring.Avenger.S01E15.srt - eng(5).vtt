00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.520
It’s been ten years. It’s been ten years.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040
It’s been ten years.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.320
It's been a long time

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.880
It's been a long time.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.720
Yes, it's been a while. It's been a while. It's been a while.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.880
Ten years.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.320
Don't you want water?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.560
It's on the floor.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.840
Kneel down and lick it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.640
You think it's dirty?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.120
You have to think it over.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.920
When the water dries up,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.960
you can't even lick it.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.320
Poor thing.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.880
Like a dog.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.520
like a dog?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.720
is meaningless.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.800
I know.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.280
Stay alive.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.960
to live, right?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.200
to avenge Kang Suk Woon.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.960
I advise you to give up.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.320
You can't beat me.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.880
Jiang Shuyun's death was an accident.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760
The Gu family has 10,000 ways

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.040
to deal with.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.600
You can't even get out of here.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.200
How can you talk about revenge?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.640
You're daydreaming.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.960
But it's different now.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.360
Have you forgotten

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.120
I got Mu Qiu Shan.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.240
He will come to save me soon.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.760
Are you so proud

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.920
Are you happy for your fiance being robbed?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
or are you happy

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.960
that I'll leave this place soon?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.160
You wish.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.480
Do you really think

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.400
cares about your life?

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.100
You don't understand.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.280
Because Mt. Mu

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280
never cared about you.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.079
Of course you don't understand.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.680
No one cares about you.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.560
And I'm different from you.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.680
He loves me so much.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.680
Of course he cares about me.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.280
You bitch!

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.600
You're about to die.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.940
You're still being stubborn.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.640
I told you.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.040
Things are different now.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.320
If you don't listen to me,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.840
you'll suffer.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.519
[You're the one who's going to lose.] Hey.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.320
Hey! Hey!

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.160
Are you okay?

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560
Kang Chunu.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.560
I’ll kill her

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.159
I'll kill her.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.840
Wait!

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.920
She's a prisoner now.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.080
A caged bird.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.560
If you kill her now,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.440
your hands will be dirty.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.560
And if you kill her in the House of Gu,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.480
It's not easy to deal with.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.800
The old man

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.440
We can't talk to him. Let's go.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.240
Sister,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.080
Do you have a plan?

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.240
What's the hurry?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.840
If we don't do it,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.280
someone will do it.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.760
The old man hit his own granddaughter.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.840
I feel good just thinking about it.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.480
How about

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.520
Let's watch more operas.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.880
and think of a way.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.960
Let the old man

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.760
with the old man.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.880
Okay.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.800
Use this ointment.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.000
It won't leave a scar.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.159
Bye.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.159
Wait.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.240
You used to apply medicine for me in person.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.330
Now you're leaving in such a hurry.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.300
I have something to do.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.800
Sister.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.760
I...

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.840
have a girlfriend.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.560
It's Fang Yue.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.400
Are you blind?

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.600
That bitch Fang Yue

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.240
deserves to be your girlfriend.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.880
She's a leech in the gutter.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.000
You can't get rid of it even if you want to.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.040
Just have fun.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.520
You take it seriously?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.800
Sister.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.680
Have you forgotten

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.740
I'm also from the underground ditch.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.760
All these years,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.000
I'm used to it.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.120
As long as you can climb up.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.760
I'll be your stepping stone.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.920
to help you climb up step by step

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.240
to the top.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.800
Remember to apply the ointment.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.680
You'll get a scar.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.920
Bitch!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.159
You're all bitches!

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.250
Everyone is against me, right?

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.440
Fang Yue,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.600
Meng can only belong to me.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.330
No one can take him away.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.080
Miss Leng.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.380
Master is calling you.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.480
Grandpa, you want to see me?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.120
Coming.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.840
Have a seat.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.880
Okay.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600
The marriage between the Gu and Mu families

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.680
is determined.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.320
I must not fail.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.560
It's my fault.

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.640
Sorry for making you worry.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.680
Since you know

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.200
I worked so hard.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.080
You must

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.960
you must perform well.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.620
Come on.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:54.960
Okay.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.640
Grandpa.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.400
Don't worry.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.520
Sorry.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.960
My phone died just now.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.680
I'll wait for you at the President suite of Century Hotel.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.720
Please come.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.130
I'll be right there.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.980
Wait for me.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.680
You've risked your life for her for so many years.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.840
You've worked hard even without credit.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.520
Why did she hit you so hard?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.290
You have no right to criticize her.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.360
Don't

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.480
don’t let me hear it again.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.080
Meng.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.920
I’m worried about you.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.520
I know I was wrong.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.900
I won't mention her again in front of you.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.159
Please forgive me.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.440
Today,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.000
playing so well today?

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.600
No.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.530
It doesn’t smell like Kang Chunyu.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.440
Get lost.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.240
If you don't leave now,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.700
you'll receive a lawyer's letter tomorrow.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.800
Akiyama.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.040
Let me explain.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.050
Where's Chunyu?

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.160
Why do you have her phone?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.720
Here.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.920
You should ask my grandpa.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.680
I'm warning you.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.120
Don't be too arrogant.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.400
Do you really think my Mount Mu is made of paper?

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.000
I know

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.940
the Mu family is powerful.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.560
That's why

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.170
That's why I went through so much trouble.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.890
I'll get going. Bye.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.720
I'll wait for you

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.800
at home tomorrow.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.400
Akiyama.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.960
Have a seat.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.690
Where is Kang Chunu?

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.000
Akiyama.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.820
The marriage of Gu and Mu families

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.760
was already decided.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.160
Think about it.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.520
What if I don't want to think about it?

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.380
Think about it.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.360
Our family is rich.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.040
The Mu family has many patents.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.880
The two strong companies

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.520
Not only

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.440
in the Imperial City,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.680
The whole country

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.560
in the country.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.880
Since you threaten me with spring rain,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.720
Spring Rain

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.360
will be safe for now.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.240
Since Mr. Gu knows this,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.360
why are you so insincere?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.120
If you were sincere,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.040
why would he threaten me with my people?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.040
How is that a threat?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.200
It's just a small strategy.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.640
You're so persistent.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.720
The last time you suffered here,

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.880
Here we go again.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.930
You're really not afraid of death.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.640
Look.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.080
Who said

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.400
Mu Qiu Shan?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.000
We'll get married soon.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.400
You're a famous movie star.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.040
How could you do this?

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.400
You're shameless.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.760
What's wrong with dirty tricks?

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.370
You just need to achieve your goal.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.400
This principle

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.800
When I was little,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.240
when I was little.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.240
Okay.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.160
Don't tell anyone

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.970
about what happened today.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.600
Good boy.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.480
Take it.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.120
I've told the staff.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.080
From now on,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.840
you can move to a single room.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.840
No need.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.400
eat pot dishes with others.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.440
Go. Go.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840
Kang Chunu.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.640
I’m not as lucky as you.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.480
Since young,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.120
I have to rely on calculations

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.080
to get what I want.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.800
I see.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.240
You want to use me

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.600
to threaten Mu Qiu Shan?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.880
Yes.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.960
So...

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.600
before we get married,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.680
before we get married.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.840
What if

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.320
I don't want to think about it?

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.200
The public is spreading.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.920
Everyone in the Imperial City knows

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.650
the marriage between Gu and Mu.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.280
If we suddenly stop it,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.970
it won't be good for anyone.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.840
Besides,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.840
you really like Kang Chunu.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.000
It’s OK.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.600
A successful man

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.040
more women.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.600
It's just that

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.440
Mrs. Mu just cares about him.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.660
It happened suddenly.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.770
I need to think about it.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.880
I'm old.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.920
Don't keep me waiting.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.640
Grandpa!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.680
Did Akiyama agree?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120
Not yet.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.600
But

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.760
he will eventually agree.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.240
They say

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.130
businessmen value profits

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.200
Farewell.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.880
But Mu Qiushan

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.080
is an infatuated man.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.520
Since he values love,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.880
he won’t

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.440
save Jiang Chunyu.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.240
Mr. Mu.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.680
The garage

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.960
in the garage.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.440
They must be very alert.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.240
Okay.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.400
Put down what you're doing.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.400
Use all resources

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.160
to find out

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.680
where Kang Choon Woo was locked up.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.440
Yes.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.760
Mr. Gu.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.740
Since you are not kind,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.640
don't blame me for being unjust.
