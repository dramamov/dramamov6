WEBVTT

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.080
Are you really not planning

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.480
to move in with me?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.660
When you cancel your engagement.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.180
That's when I'll move in with you.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.240
Looks like I need to find

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.880
a time to talk with Mr. Gu soon.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.760
Mr. Mu,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.760
we have news.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.160
I found that sports car

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.690
from back then at a repair shop in the suburbs.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.400
Gu Nian.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.840
Stop looking.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.920
It's just me.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.280
You slept with Mu Qiushan last night.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.520
You really have no shame.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.960
I've always said

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.560
you're just a pretentious bitch.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.640
Why are you here?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120
Jiang Chunyu.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.610
We've known each other for over ten years.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.680
We were high school classmates.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.200
I'm kindly warning you.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.210
Leave Shangcheng while you still can.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.919
Otherwise,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.820
you won't be able to leave even if you want to.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.520
My grandfather's methods

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.880
are beyond your imagination.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.440
You should worry about yourself first.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.720
Your greatest value to the Gu family

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.000
is just for marriage alliance.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.460
If you can't fulfill that,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.280
you'll be thrown out

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.720
of the Gu family like trash.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.480
Trash?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.400
You're the trash!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.079
You don't even deserve

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.120
to stand next to me, you slut!

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.960
Gu Nian.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm warning you.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.000
Don't test my patience.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.850
Or one day when I'm tired of playing along,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.240
we'll both go down together.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.600
Stop trying to scare me.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.800
If you wanted to kill me,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.360
you would have done it already.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.520
No need for all this drama.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.400
Because the blood of someone like you is too dirty.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.570
It's not worth getting on my hands.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.200
After all, my life

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680
was given to me by my beloved mother.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160
Unlike you,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.120
who abandoned your own birth mother.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.040
Shut up!

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.360
I said shut up!

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.560
Let go.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.440
Or I'll slash that face of yours.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.280
Let go!

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.880
Jiang Chunyu.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.960
You won't be so arrogant for long.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.480
Just wait for your death.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.120
These two are at loggerheads.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.850
It's still unclear who will win in the end.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.960
I'd better hold my position

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.290
and stay out of trouble.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.240
From what she's saying,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.920
it doesn't sound like she's exaggerating.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.740
Could it be that the old man

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.400
has already taken action?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.040
Anyway,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.740
I should discuss this with Mu Qiushan first.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.000
Mr. Mu,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280
this is the place.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040
Let's split up and search.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.800
Okay.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.340
Please be careful, Mr. Mu.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.490
Don't worry.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.280
I know what I'm doing.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.760
Yes.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.960
Strange.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.220
Why isn't he answering his phone?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.410
I never expected

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.440
that old Mr. Gu

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.170
would take this marriage alliance so seriously.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.720
I've been outmaneuvered.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.770
But now that we're here,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.520
we can only take it one step at a time.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.520
Why did you ambush me?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600
Who sent you?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.480
I saw you sneaking in here

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.400
and thought you were a thief stealing car parts.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.159
I wanted to teach you a lesson.

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.159
Are you the owner of this garage?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.000
Then whose sports car is this?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.640
What sports car?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.520
I don't know.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.440
Please! Please! Please!

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.970
Spare me!

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.920
How about

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.440
I ask the manager for you?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.200
It seems to be just a misunderstanding.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.800
I'm a collector of vintage cars.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.720
Although this sports car has been modified,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.600
it still has good collection value.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.280
If the owner is willing to part with it,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.880
I'm willing to pay a premium.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.320
This car

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.480
has been parked here for a long time.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.040
Nobody has touched it either.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.760
I thought

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.920
it had been scrapped long ago.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.440
I didn't expect

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.560
it to be so valuable.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560
Old cars like this

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.640
are treasures to those who appreciate them.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.720
Otherwise, they're just scrap metal.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.520
Tell you what.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.200
I can pay a deposit first

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.400
to show my sincerity.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.960
It's best to contact the owner quickly

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.040
to meet with me in person.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.440
The price is negotiable.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.120
Chunyu.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.360
Did something happen?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.280
Don't worry.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.810
Nothing happened to me.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.600
There are just too many scammers nowadays.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.860
Better to be cautious.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.320
That's good.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.520
By the way,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.680
is that Mr. Mu your boyfriend?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.520
He seems nice.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.000
You know,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.760
you're not getting any younger.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.160
You should settle down and start a family soon.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.120
Shuyun would

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.520
rest in peace

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.920
knowing you're settled.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.480
Okay.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.400
Don't worry, auntie.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.080
Auntie,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.560
it's getting late now.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.760
You should head back.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.760
Alright.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360
Take care.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.280
Bye-bye.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.500
My phone number is on this.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.559
My surname is Lin.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.159
Okay.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.000
Mr. Lin,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.799
our boss will contact you.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.400
Mr. Mu,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.260
how's it going?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.520
Something seems wrong with Chunyu.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.400
I'll go back and check.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.320
Keep an eye on things here.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.000
Yes.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.480
Where's that damn woman

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.680
gone off to now?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.160
Hey.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.000
Hey, Meng.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.880
Someone's offering good money for that car.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.410
Should we just get rid of it?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.960
Who is it?

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.200
Surname Lin.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.720
Don't know much about them.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.280
But

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.680
they seem pretty loaded.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.060
Let's find out more about them first.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.680
Got it.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.680
Okay, hanging up.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.000
Meng.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.000
Why are you here?

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.320
Then I'll...

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.360
Don't bother.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.360
I'm not in the mood.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.960
I'm hungry. Go make some food.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.760
Okay.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.000
What's this?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.680
It's for you.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.540
Consider it payment for the meal.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.280
Meng.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.610
How did you know I wanted

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.200
this limited edition bag?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.930
I've had my eye on it for so long.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.600
Thank you.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.380
So you actually have double eyelids.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.680
It's just a bag.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.480
My sister has a whole room full of them

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.140
and she's never this excited.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.960
Gu Nian is a big star.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.060
How could I compare myself to her?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.760
Besides.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.400
If she hadn't been adopted by rich people,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.800
she'd be just like me.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.040
What are you mumbling about?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.280
Nothing.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.520
Meng.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.400
Just wait.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.760
I'll definitely cook a great meal today

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.960
to treat your stomach.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.560
Alright, alright. Go ahead.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.560
The old man is causing trouble.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.620
Come back quickly!

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.840
I'm not staying for dinner. I have to go.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.880
Meng!

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.800
Get some water to splash her awake.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.320
Yes.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.880
I've already warned you

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.770
not to refuse the easy way and choose the hard way.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.560
Anyone who dares to interfere with the Gu family's affairs

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.160
must be punished.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.920
Stop!

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.920
If you want to live,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.160
leave Mu Qiushan immediately,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.520
get as far away as possible,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.680
and never come back.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.040
I'm not the one who should leave.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.260
I'm not the one who should die either.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.120
It's Gu Nian and Gu Xiaomeng.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.720
You insolent girl!

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.120
You're asking for death.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.320
Dad.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.440
Unless you beat me to death,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.100
otherwise,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.210
I will definitely marry Mengting.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:31.880
Sir,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.680
what's wrong?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.160
Let me tell you the truth.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.200
The marriage between Mu Qiushan and Gu Nian

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.080
concerns the future of both companies.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.200
No one can stop it.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.240
You should know your place.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.000
No need to hit her anymore.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.440
Just keep an eye on her.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.400
Yes.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.680
I was too careless.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.520
I underestimated the Gu family's tactics.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.490
I must find a way to escape quickly.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.120
Don't waste your energy.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.560
You won't be able to escape.
