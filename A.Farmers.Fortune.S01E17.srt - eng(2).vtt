Who are you, truly?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.440
In the days to come,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.440
I ask that you look after my family.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.640
Fu.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.610
Fu.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.020
(Seal of Fu Qinghuai)

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520
If you wish to keep it to yourself,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.440
I won't force you to explain.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.400
When the time comes,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.720
you can tell me then.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.440
Father, Mother, dinner time.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.960
I made this bowl myself.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.300
It didn't turn out well,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.040
so Tangbao made another one.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.840
For the taste,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.920
it's a little off,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.560
but it's already better than my cooking.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.920
Tangbao is a girl,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.360
born with a knack for cooking.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.800
Maybe I should learn something else.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.040
Remember what your mother told you?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.440
Work is only about whether you enjoy it

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.280
or you're good at it.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240
It doesn't depend on gender.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.200
That's right.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.920
Xiaosheng,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.760
don't let a momentary setback

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.920
make you give up so easily.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.560
Once we reclaim Fengyang House,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.200
we'll need you and Tangbao

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240
to keep its legacy alive together.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.160
Let our Fengyang House

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.600
stand for a hundred years,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.920
even a thousand.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.360
Really?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.160
I have faith in you.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.080
Mother.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.120
I understand now.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.360
I will carry Fengyang House forward

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.080
and open for ten thousand years.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.600
Well, how many

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.680
hundred years make ten thousand years?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.200
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.680
No, that's not right.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.400

That's all you're offering?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.990
You think I don't know my trade?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.560
I want to see Wang.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.320
Our boss isn't here.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400
And he won't meet you.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.840
These bits you've brought

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.480
only worth this much.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.040
Couldn't you give me more?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.760
I'm not some drifter to shoo away.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.760
A drifter's better off than you.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.560
See that food shop?

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.920
They've leftovers to spare every day

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.580
and give it away to those in need.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.480
Each one's fed till they're rosy.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.000
Go, go, go.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.280
Don't hold up my business.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.040
- I need to see Wang.
- Move along.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.400
I said I need to see Wang.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.400
Excuse me, do you know this guy?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.400
Still not leaving?

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840
Looks like the shop owner's husband

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.920
from that food shop.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.680
Thank you.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.160
Honey.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.520
Datian.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.040
Before He Qingqing married
into the Fu Family,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.320
had she met Fu Qinghuai?

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.760
Yes, she had.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.880
But she only saw him once

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.400
when he first arrived in He Village.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120
Back then,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.160
he wasn't even as tall as me.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.280
I've always found that odd.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720
At the Ancestral Hall,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.200
I saw Fu Qinghuai's skill.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.600
Hardly looked like a man of letters.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.280
Earlier today, I saw a man

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.880
holding a portrait, looking for someone.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.960
No, my girl.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.440
What are you planning now?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.680
I wouldn't dare cross that family again.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.600
Look at you, so spineless.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.720
You want to live off scraps?

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.880
I'm certainly not.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.280
The one with the surname Fu.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.560
Something's off about him.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680
It really is you.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.520
Watch your words.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.600
You'd better come back with me.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.260
He's been looking for you like mad.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.000
Let's just

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.880
pretend we never met.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.160
He commanded us

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.880
to find you, alive or dead,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.600
even if we have to beat you up.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.960
That's so him.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.000
You know him.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.680
He kills without batting an eye

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.760
and lives by swords.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.320
If I ever dared lie to him,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.000
I'd be risking my very tongue.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.240
What are you...?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.440
If that's the case,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.920
I can't let you go back.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.160
Tie me up tighter this time, Young Master.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.320
Lives by swords...

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.520
Fu Qinghuai,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.600
who exactly are you?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.280
Tangbao, what do you
feel like eating today?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.120
Mountain bandits!

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.600
Mountain Bandits, you say?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.040
Take a look at this.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.560
Aunt Zhou, what bandits
were you just talking about?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.160
This notice says: The authority

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.400
wiped out a den of mountain bandits.
But their chief

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.140
(Notice: Bandits In Town)
escaped.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.600
Chances are he's slipped into our town.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.440
My nephew works at the County Yamen.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.560
He said the chief
looked refined and proper.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.000
So he managed to evade capture.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.120
We all need to keep our guard up.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280
Yes, that's right.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.680
(Even the timing
of his return matches...)

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.260
(Could Fu Qinghuai)

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.280
(be the mountain bandit chief?)

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.400
Mother, what's a bandit?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.280
They sneak into your home
to steal your treats.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.280
A troublemaker.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.600
Tangbao knows where the bandit is.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.160
Tangbao will take you there.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.020
(Notice: Bandits Roaming Into This Town)

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.500
(Stay vigilant, townsfolk.)

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.120
Listen up, little bandit.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.160
(Next Episode)
We know you are inside.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.120
Even if I keep quiet,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.120
others sent will still find this place.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.520
Qingqing,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.760
I need a word with you.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.600
Tangbao,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.560
I am your father.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.680
You claim to be Fu Qinghuai.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.200
Do you have any proof?

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.040
He already, in advance,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.600
sent documents that could prove my identity

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.040
to the Village Chief.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.000
They took father away.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.240
