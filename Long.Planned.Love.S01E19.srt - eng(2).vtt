00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.070
How did I end up raising someone
like you?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.670
In front of so many people,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.600
you put on that touching sibling act.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.790
How can we hold our head up after this?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.790
How am I supposed to survive
in this circle?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.680
Dad,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.200
I'll take care of this.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.590
Take care of it?

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.640
How?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.950
By marrying the Wang Family's daughter

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.680
to cover up your covert affair?

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.150
Dad.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.640
Oh,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.790
that's so heavy.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.310
Oh, everyone's here.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.070
Wait, not quite.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.350
Jian Wenqian's not here.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.750
Jian,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.510
where's your most capable daughter?

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.920
Why doesn't she come see you?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.640
Ms. Mei,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.040
where's your sweetest little darling?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.510
You're already sick.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.390
She doesn't even stay home
to keep you company?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.430
Jian Cheng,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.640
I heard from Wenqian

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.200
that you told Mom to go over.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.950
Why did you do that?

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590
You've thrown the whole house
into chaos.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.680
What can you gain from this?

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.400
It's truly a shame.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.480
Jian Youhui,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.760
the reason why I've always yielded
to you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.560
is that Grandma said

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.050
she has high hopes for you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.880
and she wants you
to carry Changsheng Group.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.120
But now,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.190
Jian Wenqian is set on destroying you.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.080
So I can't hold back anymore.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.440
If someone's going to bring you down,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.310
better it be me.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.680
You did that on purpose

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.030
last night, didn't you?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.470
Yeah.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.680
So what if it was on purpose?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.630
Did I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.240
hold Jian Wenqian's head

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.550
and force her to kiss Jian Youhui?

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.960
Cheng,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.800
aren't you classmates
with Wang Niannian?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.580
How about you go have a word with her?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.560
She absolutely can't let this slip out.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.560
Obviously.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.470
If news about Jian Youhui
and Jian Wenqian gets out,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.590
I'll be humiliated too.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.800
You know the Zhou Family well.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.900
If they find out

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.610
something like this happened
in my family,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.240
I'd never be able
to hold my head high again.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.960
Wang Niannian

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.400
swore on her late mother's name

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.000
that she would never breathe a word.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.080
Alright, alright.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.030
I gave her five million to keep quiet.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.410
Remember to get me reimbursed.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.590
Money, money, money.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.190
You only care about money.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.710
She's the dignified daughter
of the Wang Family.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.190
Why did she need hush money?

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.210
I'm the daughter of the Jian Family.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.630
I still ask for money for everything

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.800
as of I'm obsessed with money.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.710
Who would complain
about having too much?

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.050
You!

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.990
She asks for five million,
then just give her it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.620
- Exactly.
- Any car you casually give to Wenqian

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.870
is worth more than five million.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.030
Give Cheng what she wants.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.280
Cheng, what should we do now?

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.270
How about

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.590
we sent her abroad?

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.190
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.470
After a few years,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.710
maybe no one will even remember this.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.240
Dad, Wenqian

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.200
is a young woman.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.270
Being alone overseas isn't safe.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.520
When I was 18,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.870
you sent me away for five years.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.470
Even a teenage lunatic like me could go.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.630
She's a sound-minded woman
in her thirties.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.520
Why can't she go?

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.590
You really treasure Jian Wenqian,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.470
Jian Youhui?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.590
Hello.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.680
The number you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.750
(Alright, Jian Youhui,)

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.630
(even you don't help me.)

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.800
If my life's about to fall apart,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.070
then let it all fall apart.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.760
Jian Cheng,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.600
if I'm miserable,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.720
you're not having it easy either.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.230
Miss Su,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.990
Director Mei's film isn't even
finished yet.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.910
Why come back suddenly?

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.720
Something urgent?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.910
Yeah.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.660
(Su Yun, Award-winning actress)
A very important person

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.520
is having a birthday.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Who is that person?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.520
Sorry.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.610
The person you're calling…

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.590
Tang.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.720
Cheng.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.850
Su Yun's back in the country.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.720
Did you see the news?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.870
Yeah,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.750
I did.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.870
She's all over the Trending Topic list.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.870
Director Mei generally doesn't allow
taking leave from shooting.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.750
Su Yun's got some guts.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.920
Looks like

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.600
that the person

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.920
must be pretty important.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240
What a coincidence.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.920
Over here,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.800
someone's celebrating a birthday today.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.940
And he's very important, too.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.800
I'm setting up

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.920
a candlelight dinner for him.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.800
No public display of affection.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.440
Well,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.360
Zhou Tingyan's birthday parties
in the past,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.750
honestly,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.000
were always pretty dull.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.350
Still, he celebrated it every year.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.080
He suddenly doesn't celebrate it
this year.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.110
Hey,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.960
Cheng,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.680
don't tell me it's because of you.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.660
I won't hold the birthday party
this time.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.380
Since Jian Cheng never celebrates it,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.400
me neither.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.680
I follow her.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800
Seriously?

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.680
Just enjoy it quietly.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.680
(Let me snap a photo and send it
to Zhou Tingyan.)

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.860
(Honey)

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.750
Honey,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.670
you look great.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.870
Come home early tonight.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.710
OK.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.990
(Zhou)
My wife arranged these flowers for me.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.880
Nice, right?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.630
Show off your love,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.480
break up fast.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.620
(Unknown number)

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.400
Hello?

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.670
This is Su Yun.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.000
You go back.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600
I want to see him.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.680
I want him to tell me in person

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.520
that he's married.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.790
I've waited for him all these years.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.920
All I want is just one word from him.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.050
Is that too much?

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.150
Su Yun,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.920
for so many years, Zhou

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.630
has always treated you like his sister.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.880
Pestering him like this
isn't helping anyone.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.840
Qin Zhuo,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.240
if I mention my brother,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.430
he will agree to see me.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.450
The reason why I don't mention him

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.870
is that I don't want to remind him

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.120
of the chain he still carries.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.200
Hello?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.800
Su Yun's at the clubhouse.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.750
Tell her to go back where she came from.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.860
She mentioned that person.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.840
Cheng.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.150
Cheng.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.440
Cheng.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.270
Cheng.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.950
Tingyan,

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.790
go.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.840
Let's go together.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.360
Let's go together.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.270
Hang in there.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.270
Tingyan...

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.440
Tingyan...

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.160
- Tingyan...
- Let's go together.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.560
- Tingyan...
- Let's go together.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.000
Tingyan, listen to me.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.910
Tingyan,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.310
I'm entrusting my sister

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.920
to you.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.680
Take good care of her.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.120
Take good care of her.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.470
Cheng.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.400
Cheng.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.400
Cheng.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.320
Pan,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.600
do you think

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.590
I'll get beaten up later?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.550
Yeah, I'd say so.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.870
Then I'm going first.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.390
Cover for me.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.040
Mr. Qin,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.790
maybe you should stay and handle it.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You can't outrun trouble forever.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.630
You're built pretty tough.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.480
Help me take the hit later.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.130
I'm not great at taking hits either.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.720
When Mr. Zhou loses his cool,

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.030
only Mrs. Zhou can calm him down.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.790
How about I call Mrs. Zhou?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.440
Are you trying to get me killed?

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.870
So,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.200
Pan Yu was telling the truth.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.270
You're already married?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.750
Yeah, I'm married.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.910
Married?!

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.600
You're married?!

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.110
How could you...

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.200
How could you get married?

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.440
How could you marry someone else?

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.390
Didn't you say you'd wait for me?

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.350
Zhou Tingyan,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.200
you said you'd always wait for me.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.200
When did I ever say I'd wait?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.390
I previously said

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.390
that my wish

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.690
is to leave the entertainment industry
at 30

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.030
and get married at 30.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.150
You said you'd wait till I turn 30.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.320
If I remember it right,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.940
I only promised to protect you
in the industry until 30,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.790
ensuring everything goes smoothly.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.190
If you want to marry,
I'll prepare the dowry.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.270
When did I ever say I'd wait for you?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.790
And I never said I'd marry you.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.730
- But I...
- Su Yun,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.030
from the very start,
I made my stance clear.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.440
I'm just taking your brother's place
to take care of you.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.280
Other than that,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.510
there's nothing between us.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.710
Oh,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.900
he didn't even give you a proper look.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.720
Mr. Qin, pray for heaven's blessing.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.630
He's rushing home to see his wife.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.840
I guess he's got time to deal with me.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.200
Zhou Tingyan

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.240
is deeply in love with his wife?

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.350
Truly in love.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.680
Su Yun,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.590
Zhou has treated you well
all these years.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.150
He spent half his life paying off debts.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.390
Now, he has finally

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.910
managed to live the life
he wanted

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.734
and marry the woman
who he wants to marry.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.000
Can you just not disturb him anymore?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.200
Compared to that woman,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.200
I really don't stand a chance at all?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.390
Not even the slightest.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.550
I want to meet his wife.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.840
I want to know

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.120

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.800
