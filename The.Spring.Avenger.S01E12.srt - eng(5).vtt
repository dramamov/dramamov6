WEBVTT

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.160
Who are you?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.370
Someone who wants you dead.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.440
Many people want me dead.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.810
Who do you think you are?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.960
Jiang Chunyu.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.800
I knew it was you.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.520
Playing your tricks.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.320
I was just playing a little joke.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.100
Why are you so frightened?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.960
Guilty conscience.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.729
Makes you jumpy.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.640
This is my dressing room.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.640
If you don't leave now,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.120
I'll have someone throw you out.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.920
Miss Superstar,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.120
don't get angry.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.080
Today,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.160
I really can't leave.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.360
Because

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.240
I'm here to be your stand-in.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.560
Director!

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.160
Director!

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.080
What's wrong?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.080
Please remove this person.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.370
She's not worthy to be my stand-in.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.680
Miss Gu,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280
please bear with us.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.960
We're shooting an important scene today.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.800
At this point,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.520
it's difficult to replace someone.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.320
Come on,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.540
it's getting late.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.360
Take some time to prepare yourself.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
We'll start shooting in 10 minutes.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.560
Come on, everyone,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.520
hurry up!

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.920
Gu Nian.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.400
Your memory is still so poor.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.840
Didn't I tell you?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.200
I will take everything from you.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.920
Mu Qiushan.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760
Old Mr. Gu.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.560
Even your celebrity status.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.880
Everything you care about

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.640
you'll lose bit by bit.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440
Bitch.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.360
There are cameras everywhere here.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.560
If you really slap me,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.920
tomorrow's top entertainment news

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.520
will be 'Superstar Gu

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.840
bullying her hardworking stand-in for no reason.'

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.170
Think about your image.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.680
Can it withstand such public criticism?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.880
Jiang Chunyu.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.560
Don't get too cocky.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000
I'll find a way to deal with you sooner or later.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.680
Alright.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.420
I'll be looking forward to it.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.120
Don't let me down.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.520
See you later.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.920
Meng.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.880
Why are you here at this time?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.360
It must be boring staying in the hospital alone.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.160
So

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.880
I thought I'd come keep you company.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.160
Director.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.880
Gu Nian,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.680
this is our key scene.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.840
It's mainly about bullying.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.240
In a moment,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.720
the villain will stab your eyes,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.480
then throw you off the building.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.560
After the fall, you survive,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.760
then make a comeback for revenge.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.080
That's the overall plot.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.400
But don't worry,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.200
for the later parts,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.600
we'll use a stunt double.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.320
You just need to act well in the dialogue scenes,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.720
and capture the facial expressions

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.360
at the moment of falling.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.360
Okay.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.240
All right,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.800
fine,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.560
carry on.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.800
In a moment,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.840
check all the safety wires

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.700
and equipment.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.720
Jiang Chunyu,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.970
since you've chosen to provoke me,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.680
you must be prepared to face the consequences.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.480
Ready!

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.920
All departments prepare for shooting.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.000
Action!

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.360
Those eyes are truly disgusting.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.060
Better if you go blind.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.320
No!

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.960
Stop!

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.880
Please don't!

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.800
I love watching you struggle desperately

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.480
when you have nowhere to run.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.240
No!

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.440
Quick! Are you okay?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.080
Let me see.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.720
Hurry!

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
Check if they're okay.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.840
Hurry!

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.600
How is it?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680
Are they alright?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.600
Hey!

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.880
What?

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.120
Okay, I'm coming over now.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.920
Get up.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.240
Did you do this?

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.960
What are you talking about?

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.090
I don't understand.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.800
Stop playing dumb with me.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360
Why did the rope break for no reason?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.200
Indeed.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.640
It was fine.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.400
How did your rope break?

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.380
Could someone have tampered with it?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.480
So you admit it?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.060
It was you who did this, wasn't it?

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.280
Do you realize you almost got me killed?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.960
I really didn't do it.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.600
There are cameras everywhere here.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.880
If I did it,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.120
you can hit me later.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.000
Director.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.040
Break it up.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.600
Everyone disperse now.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.360
Get back to work.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.000
Gu Nian,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.170
calm down first.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.200
If someone records you acting like this,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.840
it could seriously damage your reputation.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.640
Director.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.400
I really didn't do it.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.520
I'll have someone check the security footage.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.760
Director.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.880
Let's not do that.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.799
Are you sure you don't want to check?

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.600
If we check the footage,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.560
I'll be exposed.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.280
Director.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.640
It's just

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.400
an accident.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.620
Not worth making a fuss about.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.400
Fine.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360
That's it for today.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.560
Go home and get some rest

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.090
and adjust your condition.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.960
Come on, everyone,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.000
pack up your things.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.680
We're done for today.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.400
We're done.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.650
I never thought after all these years.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.320
You haven't improved at all.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.520
Your schemes to harm others

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.980
haven't improved either.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.520
Enough.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.320
Since we're not filming anymore,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.850
I won't play along with you.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.600
Goodbye.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.100
How could this happen?

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.200
Gu Nian.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.840
A little gift for you.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.040
Hope you like it.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.680
Bitch.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.600
Hey!

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.760
Cancel all my appointments.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960
I need a vacation.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.560
Just you wait.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.400
You'll pay for this sooner or later.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.050
Mr. Mu, you're quite resourceful.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.330
Finding my home so quickly.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.060
I've already informed Old Mr. Gu.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.360
About canceling the engagement.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.290
There's no need,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.440
Mr. Mu.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.240
We're all adults here.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.080
It was just a game.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.840
Why take it so seriously?

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.480
Jiang Chunyu,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.720
since you've provoked me,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.330
you must take responsibility.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.760
Mr. Mu, you're not letting this go, are you?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:37.960
Grandpa,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.160
what happened?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.600
How dare you ask me!

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.640
Mu Qiushan,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.020
why did you break off the engagement?

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.440
It seems

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.280
he was still bewitched by Jiang Chunyu.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.440
Jiang Chunyu!

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.120
Grandpa,

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.880
Jiang Chunyu is no ordinary person.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.000
She approached you

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.440
with bad intentions.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.240
Last time, Xiaomeng

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.240
discovered her sinister motives

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.000
and that's why he tried to sabotage her plans.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.930
Unfortunately,

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.560
he didn't succeed.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.860
If that's the case,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.490
why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.800
You trusted her so much then.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.960
Even if I had told you,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.040
You...

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.770
you wouldn't have believed me.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.760
Could it be

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.240
I've been fooled by this little girl?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.000
Even if Mr. Mu wants to keep his reputation clean

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.860
and make me take responsibility,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.800
he shouldn't do it this way.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.480
You just broke off the engagement with the Gu family like that.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.880
Isn't that putting me in a terrible position?

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.600
Regarding Old Mr. Gu and Gu Nian,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.930
you don't need to worry.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.220
I'll handle it myself.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.160
Really?

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.840
When?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.720
Soon,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.650
but that's not what you should be concerned about right now.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.530
Come with me somewhere.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.720
Where?

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.260
You'll find out when we get there.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.480
Sis.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.480
I just went to the film set looking for you.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.940
They said you'd come back.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.200
I'm glad you're okay.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.460
You scared me to death.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.080
Come here.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.140
Before you came to find me,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.650
what were you doing?

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.400
You went to see Fang Yue.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.040
You smell of cheap perfume.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.200
I'll go take a shower now.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.000
Wait.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.960
You're not seriously thinking of marrying Fang Yue, are you?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
Forget it.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.080
Do whatever you want.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.080
Sis.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.120
I heard Mu Qiushan is breaking off the engagement.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.560
That's perfect.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.120
You don't have to marry him anymore.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.640
I can stay single forever too,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.240
and be with you for life, Sis.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.920
Have you?

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.330
Have you forgotten?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.960
I absolutely refuse

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.640
to spend my whole life in the mud

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.840
entangled with filth.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.140
As long as I can escape my past,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.520
even if it's not Mu Qiushan,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.200
anyone else,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.600
I don't care.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.320
I understand.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.440
I'll go first.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.520
What's that?

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.960
Guess.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.640
You know what?

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.760
I gave up painting

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.320
almost ten years ago.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.240
I thought

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.100
I would never pick up a brush again in my life.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.600
But then I met you,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.640
and my dead heart came back to life.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.680
I can paint again.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.720
Mom.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.120
Is my birthmark ugly?

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.880
No, it's not.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.280
It'll look beautiful after I finish drawing on it.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.140
What flower are you drawing, Mom?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.760
A rose.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.650
That must be beautiful.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.960
As long as it's drawn by you,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.720
I want to keep it forever.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.880
How absurd.
