00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.720
It's been a while.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.120
How have you been?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.620
You two knew each other?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.590
You can tell me anything, okay?

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.020
Can you go to Khun Rain’s house with me instead?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.250
Why not ask Master Rin to come along?

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.150
Sure.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.020
How many nights are we staying?

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.350
Told you, we’ll be seeing each other a lot more.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.850
Better if we just focus on our own work.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
That booking isn’t for this month.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.020
Are you sure this is the right way?
Scared of ghosts?

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.350
What’s wrong with the car?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.190
Hey! The tire’s flat.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.190
Where the hell are we?

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.250
Try calling a garage around here.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.890
No signal.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.050
You got any, lady?

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.550
Nope, same here.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.920
Where the hell are we?

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.120
I think we'd better walk.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.850
Right now?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.550
Or do you want to sleep here? That’s even creepier.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.450
No other choice then.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.990
Let’s walk. Come on, hurry up.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490
It’s late. How do I open this?

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.620
Please take care of the car, P’ Wan.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.350
Thanks, P’.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.620
He was so nice.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.620
Thanks again, P’.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.550
Go on, lady.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.650
Whoa, lady, this place looks haunted, like the one from that ghost show we listened to today.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.250
Uh, no staff here, we should leave.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.150
[Scream]

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.950
Hello, how may I help you?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.590
Any chance there are two rooms available?

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.990
Lucky you, there are exactly two rooms left.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.580
Lucky number, too!

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.920
I’ll give up the lucky one for you, lady.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Let’s go.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.190
Bye, lady.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.120
That night, the hotel was fully booked.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.020
Only one room left. Number 13.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.790
There was a Taowessuwan talisman on the door.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.120
And the room was filled with weird stuff.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.190
At first, I wasn’t scared.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.620
But the moment I opened the door—

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.020
a musty smell hit me hard.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.350
There was even a Buddha shelf above the bed.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.190
And that’s not all.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.390
There were nine one-baht coins.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.490
They were placed right on the headboard.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.950
I’m sure someone must’ve died in that room.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.450
[Scream]

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.990
Hey!

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.940
[Scream]

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.250
Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Oh my god, Rin!

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.890
Can I sleep here?

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.190
Why not sleep in your own room?

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.490
Don’t tell me you’re scared of ghosts?

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.090
It smells musty. I can’t sleep in there.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.590
Then open the window.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.720
The bed… it’s so hard.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.350
How about this —

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.850
if you admit you’re scared of ghosts,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.190
I’ll let you sleep here.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.120
I’m not scared.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.420
[Scream]

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.550
Rin… Rin Rin Rin
Rin, please open the door!

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.350
Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Open up!

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.620
Rin! Rin! Rin!

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.990
Okay okay! I’m scared! Let me sleep here!

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.790
Rin! Open the door!

00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:00.220
[Music]

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.150
[Music] Just having you by my side today makes everything perfect.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.620
Your heartbeat tells me, The answer is you.
(The answer is you.)

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.520
There’s no reason why I love you,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.920
It just has to be you.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.120
The one I choose today is you.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.590
I want you beside me,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.550
Always.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.650
What are you doing, lady?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.320
Getting ready to sleep. We’ve got work early tomorrow.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.020
Then why are you sleeping on the bed?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.820
- What, you expect me to sleep on the couch?
- Exactly.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.750
You should sleep on the couch. I should sleep on the bed,
because, this is my room!

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.720
But I’m the one paying for this room.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.820
And for this whole trip.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.520
Including your meals, too.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.220
Fine! I’ll let you have it this time.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.820
Yeah right, now you bring up money.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.790
Hope a ghost paralyzes you.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.520
Boo!

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.580
Hope it paralyzes you too.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.760
Not! Scared!

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.820
[Sigh]

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.450
Can you stop moving? You’re too noisy. I can’t sleep.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.520
It’s just not comfortable.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.550
Ah!

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.720
Ow— okay okay, you can sleep on the bed.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.890
But don’t move, okay?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.220
Really?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.190
Hey, sis.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.590
Do you think we can beat Mind Space?

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.090
Of course.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.090
We’re not gonna lose.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.220
Why not?

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.590
Why can’t we lose?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.720
Because the one named Mind

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.780
is the person I hate the most.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.450
And also your first love, right?

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.450
You can tell me about it.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.950
You’ve been holding it in for a long time, haven’t you?

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.150
Trying to act strong.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.790
Because that old hag hurt you, right?

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.620
I may talk a lot,

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.490
but I’m a good listener.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.850
And I’m, a great secrets keeper too.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.390
P’Mind used to be my p' tutor when I was in Senior High.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.990
We spent a lot of time together after school.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.420
Is this okay, P’Mind?

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.790
I told you, there’s no right or wrong. Just keep drawing.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.550
Okay, P’Mind.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.420
P’...

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.420
Yes?

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.750
Nothing. Let’s keep drawing.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.920
On the last day I studied with P’Mind,

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.920
- I drew a picture of a house for her as a gift.
- You eat like a kid, you’ve got stuff all over your mouth.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.290
I really put my heart into it.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.500
Thank you.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.920
P’Mind.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.840
I have something to show you.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.490
What is it?

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.320
Here.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.420
Open it.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.850
I drew this house to thank you for tutoring me.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.020
You’re my inspiration, P’Mind.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.390
I want to be a great architect like you.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.220
P’Mind.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.220
You don’t like it?

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.790
It’s beautiful.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.500
Who would’ve thought…

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.720
that P’Mind, the one I admired,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.290
would betray me.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:51.020
I don’t know what you were thinking,
but copying someone else’s work for your portfolio—

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.320
that’s a very serious matter.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.950
But I drew that myself, Professor.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.220
Look at this.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.190
I was one of the judges in that competition.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.100
I could tell at a glance.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.620
What you did, affects your university admission.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.790
I only found out on the day of my interview.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.180
That P’Mind had submitted my work to the competition
without telling me a thing.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.600
I tried to prove myself.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.540
Tried to show it was my work.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.650
But no one believed me.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.450
While I was disqualified...

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.150
from the university I dreamed of,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.960
P’Mind went on to study, became famous,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.220
opened her own company, and got recognition.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.350
Why didn’t you expose her? You still can, you know.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.050
I wanted to.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.220
But there’s no evidence left.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.120
That drawing of the house, I gave it to her long ago.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.620
She has it.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.820
Don’t lose hope yet, sis.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.190
I believe the truth is still the truth.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.020
If you just sit and do nothing, how will you get your revenge?

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.390
If there’s anything I can help with, tell me!

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.690
I’ll go fight for you myself.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.420
Then you better work hard.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.950
Win against Mind Space in this contest.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.950
Bring it on! Now I’m fired up!

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.820
I hate those cheaters!

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.590
I’ll kick their asses.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.920
Like this!

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.390
What are you laughing at? I was trying to be nice!

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.220
So… what about you? What was your first love like?

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.440
I forgot.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.260
Don’t lie, or you’re paying for your own meal tomorrow.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.220
Fine, I’ll tell you.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.620
But don’t laugh, okay?

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.750
Well…

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.290
I once liked someone from a painting.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.850
But I never even saw their face.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.750
Wait—

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.920
Hmm?

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.350
You mean you liked their art style?

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.390
Something like that.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.990
I just felt that

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.750
they must be such an interesting person.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.790
Wait—

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.950
Uh…

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.050
That’s not really love, is it?

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.120
That’s just admiration.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.590
More like being a fan.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.920
Don’t judge me like that.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.150
You talk like you’re some kind of love expert.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.020
Well, I know more than you, kid.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.490
I’m going to sleep. I’m tired.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.090
Don’t move, or I’ll send you back to the couch.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.650
[Japanese] - Excuse me.
[Japanese] - Yes?

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.890
[Japanese] Where is it?

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.820
[Japanese] Straight ahead.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.690
[Japanese] - Thank you!
[Japanese] - You’re welcome!

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:19.950
[Japanese] I found this. If anyone’s looking for it, please let me know.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.990
[Japanese] Okay, sure.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.520
[Japanese] Please wait a moment.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.590
[Japanese] Can you include this too?

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.990
[Japanese] Of course, gladly.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.820
[Japanese] Thank you so much.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.990
Rin, take some photos outside for me, okay?
I’ll handle the inside.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.250
Okay.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.250
Aokbab

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.040
Here.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.760
What now?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.240
A-lua snacks.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.740
I remember you liked them.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.620
It’s fine.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.160
Keep them.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.960
Take them. I bought them for you.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.340
When someone says no, it means no, Khun Mind.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.700
In case you didn’t know, just because she once liked you,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.920
doesn’t mean she still do now.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.760
Not always true.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.540
Sometimes the old things are still the best.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.200
If they were really good, you wouldn’t call them old.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.600
Wake up.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.580
Let’s just live our own lives.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.260
We’re not in a position to talk or give gifts anymore.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.020
You know exactly what you’ve done.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.340
I know.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.920
That’s why I’m trying to make it right.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.800
There’s no fixing it now, it’s too late.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.460
I hate you.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.860
And I’ll never forgive you.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.440
Can you really hate me?

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.900
Why couldn’t we?

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.540
Our companies are rivals now, competing against each other.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.280
It’s normal to hate your competitors.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.540
From now on, please stay away from P’Aokbab.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.240
Got it?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.740
Let’s go.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.640
What a waste of time.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.400
Where are you taking me now?

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.200
Hey, I just saved you from that old hag.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.900
Aren’t you going to thank me?

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.740
I don’t need help from a kid like you.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.200
But I saw it, you froze up back there.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.180
I’ll ask you straight.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.380
Do you want to beat Mind Space?

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.540
If you do,

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.360
I’ll give you special help.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.900
But there’s one condition.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.280
What condition now?

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.940
You have to forget the person named Mind.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.840
Forget that you ever loved her.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.260
If you can do that, I’ll help you win.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.080
That’s your job anyway.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.060
I hired you, pay you a salary, so do it well.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.320
Now get back to work,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.180
so we can finally go home.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.740
Thanks for dropping me off, lady.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.160
Can you really hate me?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.300
That’s why I’m trying to make it right.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.900
Do you want to beat Mind Space?

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.640
You have to forget the person named Mind.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.280
If you can do that, I’ll help you win.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.760
Rin.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.840
I agree.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.540
Agree to what?

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.340
I’ll erase P’Mind from my life.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.120
I want to defeat Mind Space.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.460
I’ll take back everything that’s mine.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.560
Let’s team up.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.400
Then I’ll be counting on you, sis.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.840
Let’s take down Mind Space together.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.520
Right here, Aunt Joom, make sure this counter is spotless.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:58.690
- Yes.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.380
- And underneath too.
- Yes.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.780
- And underneath too.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.620
Clean up all the snack crumbs, okay?

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.590
Spray insecticide everywhere.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.980
- Yes
- Every corner, Auntie.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.050
- Yes, sure.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.960
Especially this area, Auntie Joom.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.500
Clean up all the trash completely.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.420
Don’t let even a single crumb around here.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.460
Please make it spotless!

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.540
Bugs Spray extra strong, okay?

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.260
Not a single cockroach left.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.450
Yes, cockroaches.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.620
- Cockroaches
- Got it.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.090
Good job, Auntie!

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:12.490
Hahaha!

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:13.450
For real, bro?

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.090
Yeah, really.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.990
They asked if I preferred dark roast or medium roast, and I said spicy roast.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.450
Oh wow.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.050
They stopped selling to me immediately.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.420
Haha, serves you right, bro.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:21.820
Hey.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.890
Wait a sec.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.650
- Whoa,
- Is this really our office?

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.120
- Should be.
- Hmm.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.690
Not bad at all.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.490
Hold on.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.620
Did our office ever look this nice?

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.790
No way, bro.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.890
From now on, let’s keep it clean, okay?

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.590
Time to get to work.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.490
Yes.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.420
Yes, sir.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.850
Hey, get to work, you guys!

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.920
- Spread out.
- And keep it clean like my little sis.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.620
Why don’t you keep it clean like her too?

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.920
I do sometimes.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.120
I just forget.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.220
Why didn’t you reply to my Line?

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.000
What time will you be arriving at the office?

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.090
5 a.m.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.020
Sis, that’s 5 a.m.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.980
Who’s even awake to reply at that hour?

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.860
Someone like you.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.800
From our on-site visit,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.680
We found several issues, many parts need adjustments.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.260
Khun Rain has already said everything can be modified.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.820
We can add extensions to the house.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.700
Anyone with great ideas, feel free to shared them.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.000
He's very open-minded.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.120
That’s good.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.420
If you're blank, sugar time.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.450
N'Rin, come sit with us.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.090
I’m fine, thanks.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.220
Hey, Rin.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.690
There’s salmon sushi too.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.500
[Japanese] Itadakimasu!
[Ready to eat]

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.450
Hey, can we do that again?

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.590
One more time.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.450
Yeah.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.390
a, i, What was that again?

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.460
Itadakimasu (Let’s eat).

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.820
Yeah.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:30.450
Shall we toast?

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.020
Let’s do it.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.440
- Cheers!
- Ahh.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.580
Hmm.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.140
Your boyfriend?

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:15.820
It’s my grandma.

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:18.700
- I’ll be right back.
- I can see it says “Babe.”

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.990
P’May, I’m pretty sure it’s just like I said.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.920
- Sure.
- Right?
- For sure.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.020
About what?

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.220
Me and Yong.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.320
- We’re guessing Tertis probably has a boyfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:33.590
Having a boyfriend isn’t weird though, is it?

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.900
What’s weird is how sneaky she acts.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.080
And she keeps lying that she doesn’t have one.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.720
So I think she’s seeing someone who’s already taken,

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.850
or maybe someone married.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.290
That’s crazy, shouldn't be possible.

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:48.890
If you want to stay in this company, no romance allowed.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.920
Why?

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.490
Because you’ll get gossiped and nonstop.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.420
I really hate people who—

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.990
Hmm

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.320
Don’t judge others, Chan.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.650
You’re the worst gossip of all.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.590
Not just gossiping, you love stirring it up.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.490
Back when Tertis first joined,

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.890
you tried to ship her with Yong.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.850
It's me

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.850
Who are you shipping Rin with this time?

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.320
- Maybe Aokbab.
- Wow.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.860
If everyone spent less time gossiping love lives

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.360
and more on working,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.440
we’d have finished ages ago.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.050
- Hello, Pad?

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.420
What, an urgent meeting?

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.790
- Yeah. Shall we go now?

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:25.690
- Yeah, hurry.
- Yeah, perfect timing.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.650
Yeah, the audit just dropped by.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.380
- Right, let’s go! let’s go!
- Must be a big one.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:32.250
Keep tomorrow free.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.690
If I knew we're going on-site visit the same day as Jinta,

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720
I wouldn't be go.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.820
Come on, I just want to meet them head on

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.880
So they will know we’re not in the same league.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.820
Too bad Pad isn’t there.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.500
Next time,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.040
At least give me a heads-up first.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.190
Yeah.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.490
I’ll give you a heads-up next time.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.850
Anything else?
I’ve got to get back to the meeting.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.120
That’s all.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.320
I’m here, woo!

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:04.220
You’re late.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.520
Only five minutes, sis.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:07.920
Late is late.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.050
Be on time next time.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.790
Okay~

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.390
Didn’t you say we’re going to find inspiration?

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.720
For the house design — where?

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.190
Right here.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.020
The National Library? Seriously?

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:29.920
Be honest, sis.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.090
Why come to a library for research?

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.790
Isn’t it easier to just look up online?

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.990
Kids these days only want convenience.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.990
And adults these days love making things harder.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.050
Not everything can be found online, Rin.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:45.720
Books can give us great ideas.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.850
Sometimes they spark things we’d never think of.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.290
You talk like you’ve been here a lot.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.090
Who did you come here with?

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:05.260
I said focus on the book, not on my face.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:24.000
Ah, P'Mind! Don’t stare at me.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.090
I’m reading~

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.900
You were just looking at me.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.450
I wasn’t!

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:30.660
Then what were you looking at?

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.900
The book.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:46.790
Why are you covering my eyes?

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:48.620
Keep them closed.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.090
Don’t open them.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.560
Hey sis!

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.450
What’s wrong? Why did you go silent?

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.050
Come on, let’s go find the books.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.520
Everything here’s so old.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.740
Will this even work?

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.850
There are both old and new,

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.590
Have you even tried looking yet?

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.090
Typical kids these days.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.320
You sure like saying that.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.440
So, can you answer now?

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:46.720
Answer what?

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.980
The thing I asked earlier.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.990
You still haven’t answered me.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.790
Who did you come here with?

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.420
Why do you want to know?

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.320
I just wanna know.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.890
Come on, it’s not a secret.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.190
Who did you come here with? Tell me!

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.050
Knowing won’t do you any good.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.700
Use your time finding something useful instead.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.790
Extra overtime for me

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.420
You make it worth every penny.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.790
I know who you came here with!

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.520
Keep it down. What, Who?

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.850
Not telling. I’ll let you wonder.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.390
Can you really forget that Mind?

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.300
What kind of question is that?

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.940
Answer me first.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.580
Can you really forget?

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.560
Look me in the eyes and answer.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.060
Look at me.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.660
Look at me.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:53.850
Hello?

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.850
Hey, sis, I’ve got something to tell you.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.220
What is it now?

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.420
I’ve got a new idea.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:00.920
Set up a meeting with Khun Rain for me.

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:02.850
What for?

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:04.520
Just do it, please.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:06.420
Trust in Master Rin

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.220
It’ll work out for sure.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.450
One hundred percent! Guaranteed!

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.800
What on earth are you thinking? Huh?

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.320
You’re asking to stay at the client’s house?

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.360
Why didn’t you talk to me first?

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.120
Good thing I didn’t go along with your crazy plan.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:27.740
Khun Rain didn’t say anything though.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.700
He just said he'll ask Khun Ming first.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.650
Because no one does that!

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.720
Exactly! that’s why we should.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.820
Hey, Khun Rain!

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.400
Khun Ming agreed!

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.380
She said she loves Rin’s idea.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.220
See? Khun Ming likes it!

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.740
Sis, I think we really need to live with our work.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.740
Be surrounded by it to understand what the house needs.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.740
Didn’t you say you wanted to beat Mind Space? This is our chance.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.780
We’ve got to do something different.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.560
Trust me.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.500
You’re crazy.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.940
Crazy! But productive!

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.220
Ha, can’t even argue with that. And so she leave.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.620
Careful, or I’ll fire you.

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:32.850
Mm-hmm.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:35.790
Do you really need to bring your coffee drip set?

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:36.820
How long are you staying?

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.400
A full week.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.000
Just the two of you?

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.260
You sure you can handle that?

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.140
Why wouldn’t I?

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.060
I raised you, I know you too well.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.280
I know you inside out.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.100
I just don’t want you to have problems with Khun Aokbab.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.220
Don’t worry about that.

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:00.850
We’re not hating each other anymore.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.250
I even wonder what it would be like if we lived together.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.360
Hey, Let's bring the hand cream and give some to her too.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.940
If you get alcohol on you, your skin will peel off.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:32.480
Alcohol, alcohol! Where’s the hand cream?!

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.900
- Hello.
- Hello!

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.020
Please take care of Rin for me, Khun Aokbab.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.780
Please be patient with my sister.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.090
But if she’s too naughty, you can call and complain with me anytime.

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:46.400
P'Prim!

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.920
I’m just afraid Khun Aokbab won’t
be able to stand you and fire you.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.190
I’ll do my best, Khun Prim.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.980
Ugh, you’re just the same, both of you.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.400
Go back inside already.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.100
Aren’t you baking cookies? They’ll burn.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.490
Oh right, I’ll go now.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:50:59.720
I’m leaving.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:03.190
Let's go.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.140
Hey, wait before you go.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.840
I have a condition I want you to follow.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.890
What?

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.700
About us staying at Khun Rain’s house.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.460
I want you to keep it a secret.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.060
Don’t let anyone at the company know.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.690
Sure, that’s easy. Let’s go.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.390
Oh, Tertis is calling.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:35.320
Hey, What’s up?

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.590
Hey, Rin, can you grab a coffee from me?

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.650
I’m not going to the office today, I'm feeling sick. Sore throat.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.220
Ouch.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.490
You’re sick? Where are you going then? You’re in the car right?

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.250
I’m going to the hospital, it’s bad.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.620
Okay okay, I won’t bother you. Get well soon.

00:51:58.050 --> 00:51:58.850
Done.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.420
She's not suspicious, right?

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.200
Mhm.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:10.390
P'Pad!

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:13.020
Just answer it.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.120
It might be something urgent.

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.220
Hey! Sis! This is my house!

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:19.390
Hey.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:21.020
It’s duplicating.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:22.890
Just in case they are together...

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.220
In case Tertis catches it.

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:27.790
What’s up, P'Pad?

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.220
Can you reach Chan? He’s not picking up again.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.220
He’s probably out in the woods camping again.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.940
Oh P'Pad, I’m not going to the office this week.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.320
- I’ll be doing work at Khun Rain’s house.
- Oh.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:39.590
Oh, okay, sure.

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.920
Yeah yeah, alright, w-we’ll talk later. Bye.

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:02.450
First, let’s make the house feel more alive.

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.760
I didn’t think decorating a house would be this tiring.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.040
Way more exhausting than moving stuff in the software.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.220
Hey, why are you leaning on me?

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.390
I’m tired.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:32.620
Let me lean on you a bit.

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:34.190
Since we’re—

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:35.420
Already close.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:36.920
Right?

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.720
Just a little, okay?

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:40.420
Aren’t you getting a bit too close?

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.990
Mmm.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.420
Well, since we’re already living together—

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.220
How about we pretend to be Khun Rain and Khun Mink?

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.090
For what?

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.900
So we can know what it’s like for lovers living under one roof.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:05.860
What that feels like.

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:10.860
Uh… not really necessary.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.460
It is!

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:19.660
Didn’t you say—

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.300
You said you wanted to beat Mind space.

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:24.090
Hey.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:26.520
Why do you keep bringing that up?

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.090
Because it’s true.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.690
You can’t deny it.

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.880
I think we should change the dining table.

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.960
Since Khun Rain and Khun Mint live here just the two of them,

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:05.980
If we make the table smaller, we’ll have more space.

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.600
And the room will feel less cramped.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.050
Why change it though?

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.050
A vintage table like this is really rare, you know.

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.520
Did you really live in Japan for years?

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.760
Well yeah, that’s exactly why—

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.200
I know how important usable space is.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:28.660
Their homes aren’t as spacious as ours.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.490
You have to think carefully before placing any furniture, right?

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:33.690
But you forgot one thing, sis.

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.850
Japanese people value their belongings deeply.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.920
They’d never throw away a beautiful table like this—

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.920
especially one passed down from their grandmother.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.880
You see this table as a problem.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.860
But I see it differently.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.740
Khun Rain and Khun Ming

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.320
maybe they actually like the tight space.

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:04.520
Eating right here, with a view of the sea like this—it’s lovely.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.590
What you said does make sense.

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.640
But before we decide whether this table,

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.340
should stay or not,

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.590
it’s your job to design and think it through carefully.

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:30.890
Not just fooling around.

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.850
I’m not fooling around.

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:37.320
I’m seriously working.

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.420
Who’s fooling around?

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.890
Look at my face, so serious!

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.250
Hey, What? Where are you going?

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:53.190
The sun, It's hot!

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.050
You rather looking at me from the left side?

00:57:58.690 --> 00:57:59.920
I'll eat in the kitchen instead.

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:02.290
Wow, you’re that embarrassed?

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:06.080
No need to be shy, it’s just us.

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:54.450
Ah! Shit! Shit!

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.360
Sis!

00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:59.690
Can I sleep here with you?

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.790
I’m scared of thunder.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.320
Huh?

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.800
I’m scared, sis.

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.460
Help me.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.120
Whoa, this bed’s so soft.

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:25.290
Ugh, be quiet, I’m trying to sleep.

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:27.850
So grumpy.

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.090
Hey, tell me about the company.

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:43.320
If I tell you, you’ll going asleep, won’t you?

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:44.790
I’ll pass out.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:46.190
Why do you wanna know?

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:48.220
Well, I work here.

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:51.220
I just wanna know the history of the company.

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:55.920
Didn’t you say your mom was the founder?

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:00.820
Yeah.

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:02.990
My mom was an architect.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.320
The name “Jinta” actually came from my mother’s name.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:18.620
She loved design, and she was an amazing artist.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.200
My brothers and I have been trying to keep this company alive.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.140
Because it’s the last thing she left for us.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:38.020
So that’s why you’re so good at drawing, huh?

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.700
I’ve never shown you my drawing, have I?

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.780
You’ve seen any of my drawing?

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.280
You graduated architecture from Japan.

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:56.020
Of course you’re good at drawing.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.990
I get it though.

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:10.190
That feeling of wanting to preserved every memory of someone who’s gone.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:23.720
My mom had cancer. She passed away when I was little.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.880
I don’t have any memories of her at all.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.420
I envy you, sis.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:41.250
You have so many memories of your mom, more than I ever could.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:56.920
But sometimes, when I think about my mom, I actually feel guilty.

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:01.650
Guilty about what?

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.890
I once promised my mom

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.790
that I’d take her to Japan.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:11.590
But I never got the chance.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.590
After her funeral,

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.220
I went back to Japan again.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.740
I went to Kitakyushu—

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.700
the place my mom said she wanted to visit.

01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:55.120
I tried to follow my mom’s dream.

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.220
Until I found a house…

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.450
It made me miss her so much I couldn’t even explain it.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:12.450
It felt like she was right there with me.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.720
[Japanese] Here’s the menu.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.380
[Japanese] Are you feeling okay?

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.780
[Japanese] Is something wrong?

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.660
[Japanese] I’ve lost something very important.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.820
[Japanese] Please wait a moment.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.260
[Japanese] Is this the one?

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.840
[Japanese] It was left here in our care.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.000
[Japanese] Thank you so much. What a relief.

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:02.190
Who would’ve thought—

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:12.920
that I’d be able to smile again because of a message from a stranger.

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.890
It’s such a shame.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.490
I never got the chance to thank him.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.460
They didn’t even leave the name—

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.460
or any way to contact them.

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.060
And if you had the chance—

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.180
what would you want to say to them?

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.960
I guess…

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.960
I’d thank them.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.120
Because that notebook meant so much to me.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.040
I’d tell them that—

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.140
the message they wrote…

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.140
really gave me the strength to move forward.

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:07.020
After losing my mom.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.120
Do you still remember what the message said?

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.620
Of course. It said—

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.620
- “I really love your drawings.”
- “I really love your drawings.”

01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:31.390
“They remind me of my mom who passed away.”

01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:38.790
“Thank you for creating art like this.”

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:50.650
“Please keep drawing.”

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:59.620
How did you know that?

01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:07.120
Because I was the one who wrote it to you.

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:16.040
At Kitakyushu, three years ago.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.260
I was the one who found your notebook.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.360
[Japanese] Thank you so much.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.940
Between the two of us—

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:53.640
I guess it really was destiny.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.420
What’s up?

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.090
- Oh, my dear sis! Are you home?
- Uh…

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.690
Sis, I forgot to ask, how sweet do you want your drink?

01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:58.090
Are you sure about this?

01:11:58.450 --> 01:11:59.720
Yeah, I’m sure.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.240
“Sure” as in what we think means,

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.860
You’re going with Master Rin, just the two of you, right?

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:08.490
P’Vee, it’s urgent!

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.380
I think this Grab driver’s acting weird.

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:16.380
Come on, let me kiss on the cheek.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.120
What’s wrong with you?

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:19.220
My hand slipped!

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.420
[Music End Credit]

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.620
Love, don’t know when it started, but it’s already here.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.080
I don’t quite get why it has to be you.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:51.460
I don't know why, Just seeing you smile feels like a beautiful painting,

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:55.660
like colors filling in my heart.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.740
We might not always fit perfectly,

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:02.900
but as long as we’re close—

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:07.700
you feel the same, right?

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:14.180
Just having you by my side makes everything good today.

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:18.680
Listen to your heart, you’ll hear the answer is you.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:25.560
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:31.400
The one I choose today is you.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.400
How should we love each other?

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.440
Let’s design it with our hearts.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:43.060
Because it’s how we’ll live together,

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:50.880
from now on, every day, colored with our love.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:57.000
Just having you by my side makes everything good today.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.500
Listen to your heart, you’ll hear the answer is you
(The answer is you).

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:08.700
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:14.080
The one I choose today is you.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:19.460
I want you right here by my side,

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.480
Always.
