00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.720
Cheng,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.470
you're married now.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.840
I can tell Zhou Tingyan treats you
pretty well.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.860
If he really treats me well,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.140
what are you trying to do?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.460
Since early last year,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.460
I've been looking for a girl
for your brother.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.140
Logically speaking, your brother
is very outstanding.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.020
But a few people always can't see it.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020
They say,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.420
even with his qualities,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.740
he's still been married before.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.260
Finding someone of a lower status
would be easy.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.420
But in our social circle,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.140
we'd have to get someone
a bit less ideal.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.380
That's nonsense.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.770
So what if he has been married once?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.560
Even though, your brother
is still the best.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.340
Those people just have no insight.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.700
One day, they'll regret it.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.540
Look at you now.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.260
You're married to Zhou Tingyan.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.840
So you should help your brother more.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.940
Get him to spend more time
with your brother.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.860
When there's a dinner,
bring your brother along.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.220
Let him work more with Changsheng.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.980
Am I right?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.940
Yeah?

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.710
Ms. Mei,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.260
anything else at home I can help with?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.500
Well,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.620
your sister.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.140
I've introduced her

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.020
quite a few promising young men.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.020
But she's not interested.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.240
Your dad asked me to worry
about it more.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.740
I've introduced everyone I could.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.080
May I ask if you can find one

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.400
from Zhou Tingyan's circle?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.740
Help me keep an eye out.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.020
Alright, both jobs are on me.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.020
(Cheng has finally matured.)

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.560
Ten million for one.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.300
20 million for both.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.420
If you pay me today,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.580
I will do it tomorrow.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.500
Why do you always bring up money?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.140
You're really obsessed with it.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.150
Every time you come back,
you take things from Dad and Youhui,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.580
like a swarm of leeches passing by,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.580
with nothing left behind.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.020
Didn't you always told me to learn
from Jian Wenqian?

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.860
I'm just doing exactly that.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.940
When I was little, my toys,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.380
if she liked them,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.780
you'd give them all to her.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.500
The gifts I got over the years,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.260
whether expensive or not,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.100
as long as she glanced at them twice,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.820
you'd hand them over to her too.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.260
She's even living in my bedroom now.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.660
I've been learning from her all along.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.660
So I learned to take whatever I want.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.900
The only difference is

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.380
that I have to fight for myself,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.660
and she's got all of you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.380
fighting for her.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.500
You say I'm taking advantage of Jian.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.060
How is it possible?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.380
I'm just taking back what's mine.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.280
Everything Jian owns
belongs to the Jian Family.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.260
Before Grandma passed away,
she made it clear.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.260
Everything in the Jian Family

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.500
belongs only to me and Youhui
in the future.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.460
It has nothing to do with Jian Wenqian.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100
Stop trying to sway me, it won't work.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.980
Unless you can tell me

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.620
why you're so biased
toward Jian Wenqian.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.620
Otherwise,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.700
everything from the Jian Family

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.080
is off limits to Jian Wenqian.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.970
Have you thought this through?

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.260
My daughter

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.230
has been sweet and sensible
since she was little.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.220
She's sharp, witty,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.940
and incredibly caring.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.380
When she was little,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.220
her favorite place
was the amusement park.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.660
Right?

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.740
Yeah.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.100
I remember Cheng loved going
to the amusement park as a kid.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.380
Every holiday, she pestered us to go.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.440
But it was always crowded.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.940
We had to queue for ages each time.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.580
Oh, I remember,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.620
Dad, didn't you say you'd give her
an amusement park?

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.900
It's been years now.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.290
You still haven't kept your promise.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.660
Yeah.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.500
I've always been too busy.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.780
It's my fault I never made it happen.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.940
I owe Cheng an apology.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.820
Oh, by the way, Tingyan,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.860
I heard

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.980
that you secured
the Tianyu Amusement Park Project.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.460
Let's put that project aside for now.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.700
I have a personal matter

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.750
that I'd like to discuss privately
with Chairman Jian.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.020
We're all family now.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.220
Just say whatever's on your mind.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.660
Chairman Jian,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.140
you've laid so much groundwork,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.700
all because you want
to take a bigger share

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.880
of the amusement park project.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.580
I can take you in.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.360
But I've got one condition.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.020
Go ahead, say it.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.100
We're family now.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.820
I want to know

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.380
the real reason

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.580
why you adopted Jian Wenqian back then.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.500
Do you think Jian Cheng truly
wants to marry you?

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.390
She has had feelings for Zhou Yufeng
for so many years.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.590
How could she forget all this?

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.260
She said she hurt her head.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.460
Did she really?

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.180
Zhou Tingyan,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.940
she's just using you

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.700
to get back at Zhou Yufeng.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.480
Oh, right.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.700
There's something I need to ask you.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.180
What is it?

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.220
Jian Cheng said you planned the incident
in high school.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.980
It seems

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.380
you were involved too.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.180
I want to know

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.260
the real reason
why you adopted Jian Wenqian back then.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.500
Wenqian's father

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.140
was one of our company's veteran staff.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.610
And he had an accident in our company.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.700
Spare me the things
everyone already knows.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.600
My patience has limits.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.060
I want to know

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.460
the real reason
why you adopted Jian Wenqian back then.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.580
If you want to make this a condition,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.100
then I can only say no comment.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.340
You can't keep the truth hidden forever.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.380
If you want to hide it,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.340
then keep it buried for good.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.980
What did you

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.380
talk about with Jian Wenqian
in the living room today?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.440
Just some work-related matters.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.140
(Jian Wenqian is trying
to steal my man, isn't she?)

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.340
Tingyan.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.300
Yeah.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.140
I'm prettier than Jian Wenqian,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.740
smarter than her,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.840
and way more well-behaved.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.700
So you'd better not let her charm you.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.780
I like only you.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.340
I'll always like only you.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.740
Wow.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.410
(Yunqing)
What do you think?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.790
Wow.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.580
Uncle Jian really splurged this time.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.740
Looks like you should
bring Zhou Tingyan home more often.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.580
I took so many things
from Jian this time.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.100
He must be feeling the pinch now.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.220
Normally around this time,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.420
he would've called me
a hundred times already.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.780
I get rich!

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.540
(Jian)
Sorry. The person you're calling

00:09:50.564 --> 00:09:52.364
is busy making money.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.170
- His call.
- Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.500
Send one even if it's not.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.940
Thanks.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.920
What's going on, Jian?

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.560
Cheng, I thought for a long time
yesterday.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.820
There's something
I've always felt guilty about.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.110
So I want to take this opportunity
on your birthday

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.940
to throw you a grand celebration,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.220
to make up for our relationship.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.780
Cheng.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.100
Tang, stay out of it.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.940
Hello?

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.690
Something happened to Cheng.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.670
What happened?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.980
Since Cheng turned ten,

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.100
that awful Jian Wenqian

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.180
would always act possessed
on her birthday,

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.100
so Cheng never celebrated her birthday.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.500
Her Grandma always felt

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.620
deeply guilty about it.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.340
Before she passed away, she told Cheng

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.340
her 18th birthday must be grand.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.220
As a result, Cheng was kidnapped
at her party.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.800
Just now Uncle Jian gave her a call,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.690
saying he wants
to throw Cheng a birthday party.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.480
That's her biggest sore spot.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.940
Why bring up her birthday at all?

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.940
That's the one thing she minds most.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.820
I forgot.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.580
Does it hurt?

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.260
It was them.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.220
They got me worked up first.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.980
I was just so angry.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.060
I'm not usually like this.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.420
I...

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.940
Does it hurt?

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.100
No, it doesn't.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.980
Let Zhou Lu take you to get patched up.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.730
Mm.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.420
Come on, let's go.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.900
Ting... Tingyan,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.700
Cheng loses her temper sometimes.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.300
Tingyan, you've got to keep calm.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.820
We're still Cheng's parents after all.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.460
And we're your elders.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.700
- I know what you're up to.
- Put the stick down first.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.580
Put it down, OK?

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.700
I expect you to drop
whatever you're plotting.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.940
If you don't care about her,
stop using her.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.340
From this moment on,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.180
Changsheng's future

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.740
depends on how you treat Jian Cheng.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.020
Yes, yes.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.640
If you dare mess with Jian Cheng again,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.220
this photo frame will be
Changsheng's fate.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.180
We get it.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.340
Alright, alright.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.100
Jian.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.820
Does it hurt?

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.820
Zhou Lu,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.340
was I scary just now?

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.460
A little bit.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.060
(Zhou Tingyan saw me lose my mind.)

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.580
(I'm doomed.)

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.100
(Will he...)

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.320
Can you come to me
for this kind of thing next time?

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.940
I'm better at it than you.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.100
I can break this old house
with just two hits.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.660
You're bluffing.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.340
Sorry.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.300
I got here too late.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.250
Zhou Tingyan,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.700
what took you so long?

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.380
It's my fault.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.940
I was wrong.
