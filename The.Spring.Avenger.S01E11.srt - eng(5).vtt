WEBVTT

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.040
I didn't want to raise him at first.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.840
It was you

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.320
who insisted on adopting this little brat.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.250
The fortune teller said

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.960
if we adopted a girl,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.600
it would bring my real granddaughter

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
back to us.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.610
What you keep in mind

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.330
will eventually come true.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.120
From now on,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.600
your name will be Gu Nian.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.720
Okay.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.720
I, Gu Nian,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.680
will take good care of you.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360
Good child.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.080
Let's go.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880
Sister! Sister!

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.320
Are you leaving, sister?

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.880
I have my own family now.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.560
This is the candy you gave me.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.960
I couldn't bear to eat it.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.880
Grandpa,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.360
can you take my brother and me with you?

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.440
I promise I'll take good care of him

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.880
and won't cause you any trouble.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.360
Hit him! Keep hitting!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.530
It's not my sister's fault.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.410
I'm the one who doesn't like Jiang Chunyu.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.360
Want to teach her a lesson.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.120
Meng,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200
shut up!

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.200
You,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.840
apologize to Grandfather now.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.479
Say you'll never do it again.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.320
I'm sorry.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.680
Grandfather.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.120
You raised Meng yourself after all.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.880
You've already hit him.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.160
And punished him too.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.360
Are you really going to let an outsider

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.920
ruin years of grandfather-grandson relationship?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.720
Grandfather.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.360
Grandfather, please.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.240
Grandfather.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.280
Mr. Gu.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.860
Please don't be angry.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.400
Perhaps young Mr. Gu

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.000
has some misunderstanding about me,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.520
that's why he acted impulsively.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.400
Chunyu is really reasonable.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.560
About this matter,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.160
I'll definitely give you an explanation.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.320
How much compensation do you want?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.250
Name your price.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.200
No need.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.079
I'm not badly hurt anyway.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.000
But Young Master Gu,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.930
his bone seems to be broken.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.260
He needs to go to the hospital right away.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.000
Xiaomeng!

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.400
Chunyu!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
Not my own flesh and blood after all.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720
No matter how I try to teach him, he's hopeless.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.640
If only

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.760
I could find

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.600
my real granddaughter.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.160
Mr. Gu.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.760
I know

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.890
a very good private detective agency.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.440
If you're interested,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.960
I can recommend them to you,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.320
see if they can help.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.120
Over the years,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.680
I've tried many methods.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.320
They're all scammers.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.560
Completely useless.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.200
Alright then.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.600
But I can leave you a phone number.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.920
If you need it,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.280
you can contact them anytime.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.079
Fine.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.840
You finally came out.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.140
Did you get the short end of the stick?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.200
Someone did suffer.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.160
But it wasn't me.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.600
That's good.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.690
Let's go.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.180
I'll take you home.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.080
Wait.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.440
I have a question.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.600
What?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.160
Do you still want to continue

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.320
with the marriage alliance with the Gu family

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.640
and marry Gu Nian?

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.240
Qiushan,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.880
my brother's greatest wish

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.720
is to make Mu Corporation the leading enterprise in Shangcheng.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.580
Can you please step up and help me?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.360
It seems Mr. Mu still doesn't understand.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.159
I'm sorry,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.680
I have to go now.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.360
Xiaomeng.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.920
How did you get so badly injured?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.520
The old man was too harsh on you.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.320
Enough.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.320
Stop nagging.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.280
I'm not dead.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.400
I made chicken soup

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.220
simmered for three hours.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.760
Here, try it

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.890
and see if it's good.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.440
It's alright.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.560
If it's good, drink more.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
I can do it myself.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.840
Actually,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm a good cook.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.300
If I get married in the future,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.920
I'll definitely make soup for my husband every day

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.320
and take good care of him.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.640
You're not...

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.020
Xiaomeng, are you hungry?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600
I bought you a sandwich downstairs.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.159
You're here too?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.520
Bringing food for Xiaomeng?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.240
I made chicken soup for Xiaomeng.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.640
He said it was delicious.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.920
Really?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.400
Well, this sandwich of mine

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.760
isn't drinkable at all.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.560
I still prefer sandwiches.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.360
Here, take it.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.200
Look at you,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.440
eating like a child

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.400
with food all over your face.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.720
If there's nothing else,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.800
I'll be going now.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.760
What a tasteless fool.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.520
He deserves to be that woman's lapdog for life.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.880
I've spoken with the doctor.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.040
Apart from a minor rib fracture,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.320
everything else is just superficial.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.120
It seems

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.360
we don't need to worry too much.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.400
The old man called Jiang Chunyu

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.210
trying to downplay the situation.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.130
I don't care what he thinks.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.860
If it weren't for that,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.450
I would have killed her.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.720
Xiaomeng.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.600
I know you're not satisfied,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.850
but now is not the time for confrontation.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.760
I promise you,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.880
once the Gu family's assets

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.200
are all in my hands,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.200
you can do whatever you want.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.530
Just listen to your sister.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.360
Mu Qiushan

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.240
I've told you already

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.320
not to apply to art school.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.320
Why don't you listen?

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.920
Brother.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.360
This is my life.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.560
What gives you the right to decide for me?

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.640
Because I'm your brother.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.960
Because I raised you

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.890
from the age of three all by myself.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.360
Mr. Mu.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.300
How's it going?

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.400
Any leads?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.280
Sorry, Mr. Mu,

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.000
the car has vanished without a trace.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.530
We can't find anything.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.400
Why are you back?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.900
Where's Xiaomeng?

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.280
Grandpa.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.120
Xiaomeng is fine now.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.000
The doctor said

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.800
he can be discharged soon.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.840
Oh, Grandpa.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.960
I have good news for you.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.120
An internationally renowned director

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.040
is coming to Shangcheng to shoot a film.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.000
He specifically asked for me to be the leading actress.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.120
And he promised us

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.620
that we can place Gu family product placements in the film.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.560
Good.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.240
Well done.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.080
But all this is secondary.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.360
The most important thing

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.360
is your marriage with the Mu family.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.520
Yes, Grandpa.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120
I understand.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.010
Regarding Qiushan,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.440
I'll do my best.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.760
Grandpa,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.180
you should rest early.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.560
I'm going to read the script now.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.320
Alright,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.160
go ahead.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.120
Detective Wang?

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.640
The great star Gu is going to shoot another film.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.520
You're quite the busy person.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.360
But don't worry.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.680
I'll make sure you're even busier.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.640
Hey.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.680
Weiwei.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.960
I can't come to class today.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.280
Ms. Jiang.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280
My uncle...

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.640
He's missing.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.640
What happened?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.840
Don't cry.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.160
Tell me slowly.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.040
He was drinking all night.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.320
This morning he was gone.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.400
No one knows where he went.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.320
Don't panic.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.440
Weiwei, think carefully.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.480
Did your uncle

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.460
say anything unusual yesterday?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.360
I think he mentioned

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.890
today is the death anniversary of my parents.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.820
I just want to be a painter.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.040
Why do you insist I take over the family business?

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.840
Isn't having you at home enough?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.770
How can that be the same?

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.360
Now

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.690
times have changed.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.360
Relying on just one person working alone

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.480
isn't enough anymore.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.280
The two of us brothers

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.520
must work together.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.920
Painting and such

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.570
isn't a proper occupation.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.600
Why isn't it proper?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.920
Why is it that whatever you say is always considered proper

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.320
and nothing else counts?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.760
Stop the car.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.720
Brother.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.080
I'm sorry.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.440
I'm useless.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.280
I couldn't find who killed you.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.400
But don't worry.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.400
I will fulfill your wish.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.410
I'll make the Mu company bigger and stronger.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.560
[Husband]

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.180
The dead cannot come back to life.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.560
The best way to honor them

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.560
is to live well yourself.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.120
This truth

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.160
I understood ten years ago.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.040
Go ahead and cry if you're hurting.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.400
I won't laugh at you.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.840
I never thought

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.570
that the seemingly invincible Mu Qiushan

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.320
could be so vulnerable and helpless.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.600
Your fever has gone down.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.100
Did you stay here all night taking care of me?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.000
Weiwei was terrified.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.440
She refused to sleep.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.680
I promised Weiwei I would take good care of you.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.400
Since you're fine now,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.880
I'll be going.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.840
Chunyu.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.000
Mr. Mu,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.520
I have some personal matters to attend to,

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.180
so I need to take some time off.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.360
If you're worried about Weiwei falling behind in her studies,

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.420
you can hire another teacher for her.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.960
Don't worry about what happened last night.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.880
Just treat it

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.330
as if it were all a dream.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.360
The proud Mr. Mu,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.520
after being slept with

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.840
and then immediately abandoned,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.280
must be furious.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800
But this way,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.960
he won't be able to let me go.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.520
Jiang Chunyu

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.319
since you've provoked me

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.960
don't think about escaping.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:21.880
Hello?

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240
Alright, I got it.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.319
Good.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.480
Sis.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.520
Jiang Chunyu has already moved away from her previous place.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.320
It seems that although we didn't kill her last time,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.640
she's still scared.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.570
What about her job at the Mu family?

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840
She quit that too.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.420
They said she took a leave.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.920
I just feel

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.040
things aren't that simple.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.440
But it's fine.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.160
This persistent pest

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.240
has finally disappeared for now.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.720
Now I can focus on making my movie with peace of mind.
