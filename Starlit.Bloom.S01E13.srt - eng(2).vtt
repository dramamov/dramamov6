00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.550
Nothing.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
Just thinking about what you said
about eco-friendly materials.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.270
If we want to switch materials
for Starry Sea,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.190
why not just use gold?

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.080

Hey, Ms. Gu.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.000
This is kind of an intimate moment.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.440
You sure you want to talk about work?

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.000
(Ms. Gu?)

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.440
Fair point.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.160
If we use existing raw materials,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.360
we will save costs.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.830
(Will I embarrass myself
for bringing it up first?)

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.190
But if mining

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.390

make up for what we lose.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.240
"What we gain will never
make up for what we lose."

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.640
Yes.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:29.760
Oh, right, the annual report.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.110

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.670
Lu Xingchen,
have you ever thought about resigning?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.640
Hey, Gu Liusu.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.040
Could you really let me go?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.200
After all, I'm the personal secretary

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.430
you worked so hard to train.

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:03.080

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.990
