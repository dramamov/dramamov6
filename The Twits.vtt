00:29.833 --> 00:30.833
Me first!

00:34.416 --> 00:35.291
Give it!

00:35.375 --> 00:37.875
Oh, nice. Lovely.

00:39.375 --> 00:41.375
Once upon a time…

00:43.416 --> 00:46.708
…there were two terrible twits.

00:54.708 --> 00:57.416
And this is how they were left for dead.

00:59.708 --> 01:02.791
Wait, wait, wait. Stop!

01:04.750 --> 01:05.583
Mum,

01:05.666 --> 01:09.500
are you actually starting my bedtime story
with the characters dying?

01:09.583 --> 01:12.916
I didn't say they were dying.
I said they were left for dead.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.208
-By who?
-By whom?

01:14.291 --> 01:17.250
-By whom?
-Children and a family of magical animals.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.416
Oh.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.208
What kind of story is this?

01:21.291 --> 01:22.375
You keep telling me

01:22.458 --> 01:25.708
you want your bedtime stories
to be more emotionally complex

01:25.791 --> 01:29.666
with, I'm quoting,
"highbrow themes and lowbrow comedy."

01:29.750 --> 01:33.208
True. I just don't want
a boring, old, normal story.

01:33.291 --> 01:38.583
Well, I can assure you, my love,
this is no "normal story"

01:38.666 --> 01:41.875
because the Twits are not normal people.

01:43.458 --> 01:46.916
No, the Twits hate everything,

01:47.000 --> 01:48.916
especially each other.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.458
They've been married
for 47 miserable years.

01:54.416 --> 01:59.208
And not a day has passed
without a mean, dirty trick.

02:04.708 --> 02:09.958
The thing is, even people
who hate everything love something.

02:10.041 --> 02:15.750
For the Twits, it was a backyard
amusement park called Twitlandia.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.625
They built Twitlandia from the ground up.

02:19.708 --> 02:22.291
It was the one thing
that brought them joy.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.250
The one thing they truly cared about.

02:25.333 --> 02:28.833
The one thing
they wanted the whole world to see.

02:35.416 --> 02:38.083
There's a song And dance extravaganza

02:38.166 --> 02:40.833
And rides made out of toilets

02:41.416 --> 02:43.208
This is Twitlandia!

02:43.291 --> 02:46.041
It's the world's only amusement park.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.125
And even if the whole world didn't see it,

02:49.625 --> 02:51.666
the true heroes of our story,

02:51.750 --> 02:53.416
an orphan named Beesha…

02:53.500 --> 02:54.375
Wow.

02:54.458 --> 02:56.500
…and her best friend, Bubsy…

02:56.583 --> 02:57.666
Whoa!

02:57.750 --> 02:58.583
…did.

02:58.666 --> 03:01.625
Come to Twitlandia's
grand opening this week.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.916
-That looks like the most--
-Amazing place in the world?!

03:05.000 --> 03:08.500
I definitely wasn't gonna say
"horrifying and lame."

03:08.583 --> 03:12.000
But, Beesha,
it has a song-and-dance extravaganza

03:12.083 --> 03:14.083
and rides made out of toilets!

03:14.166 --> 03:17.500
And who doesn't want both of those things?

03:17.583 --> 03:21.541
All right, Bubsy boy,
I promise I'll take you to Twitlandia

03:21.625 --> 03:25.375
before you leave me forever next week.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.041
Whoo-hoo!

03:27.125 --> 03:28.541
Twitlandia!

03:32.583 --> 03:34.416
Oh, Jim.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.458
Ah!

03:35.541 --> 03:37.833
Look, it's our first visitor!

03:37.916 --> 03:41.000
But before Beesha
could fulfill her promise to Bubsy…

03:41.083 --> 03:42.958
Welcome to Twitlandia.

03:43.041 --> 03:44.333
Ahem.

03:44.416 --> 03:47.000
Hey! You can't go in without paying!

03:47.083 --> 03:49.958
…in fact, before the park even opened…

03:50.041 --> 03:51.583
"Condem-ned"?

03:51.666 --> 03:54.041
…the city shut Twitlandia down…

03:54.125 --> 03:56.000
What's this?

03:56.500 --> 04:00.708
…condemning it for being dangerous,
structurally unsound, and, quote…

04:00.791 --> 04:03.916
"Stinking of rancid hot dog meat"?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.333
-Oh, Jim!
-Huh?

04:06.416 --> 04:10.041
The city's…
They're shutting down our fun park!

04:11.375 --> 04:12.541
No--

04:12.625 --> 04:15.125
No!

04:22.083 --> 04:24.750
It was as if their baby
had been taken from them.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.125
Strange baby.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.291
Strange people.

04:27.375 --> 04:30.208
I do like Beesha and Bubsy
quite a bit, though.

04:30.291 --> 04:35.666
Yes, well, Beesha and Bubsy
are on a collision course with the Twits,

04:35.750 --> 04:39.125
who are about to play
their dirtiest trick yet.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.833
A prank that will condemn the city

04:41.916 --> 04:44.791
the way the city condemned Twitlandia.

04:44.875 --> 04:47.958
What are they gonna do?
Make it stink of rotten hot dog meat?

04:48.041 --> 04:51.958
Clever boy. Now, no more questions.
Just listen to the song.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.750
Oh, is this a musical?

04:53.833 --> 04:56.708
Of course it's not a musical.
What am I, a cricket?

04:56.791 --> 04:59.125
It's one song. Settle down.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.291
Bubsy goodbye video, take one.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.666
And… action!

05:02.750 --> 05:04.708
We'll miss you, Bubsy!

05:04.791 --> 05:06.833
Bye, Bubsy.

05:06.916 --> 05:12.833
I look around at all these people

05:14.208 --> 05:20.041
Nice people with their perfect lives

05:20.125 --> 05:23.500
Well, they're bored
Out of their skulls

05:23.583 --> 05:24.875
Vote for John-John.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.166
Monotonous and dull

05:28.458 --> 05:30.458
They do not live

05:30.541 --> 05:35.083
They just survive

05:35.166 --> 05:38.916
Now, we are not like Everyone else

05:39.000 --> 05:42.041
There's nobody here
That's like you and me

05:42.125 --> 05:45.625
We're one of a kind
And deep down inside

05:45.708 --> 05:49.000
We're the only ones out here

05:49.083 --> 05:53.416
Who are free

05:55.083 --> 05:56.708
I think we're set.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.833
All right, Bubsy boy,
the big day's coming up.

05:59.916 --> 06:04.125
Hit me with your favorite memory
from the Triperot Home for Children.

06:04.208 --> 06:07.041
Oh! That time I got
a potato stuck in my nose?

06:07.125 --> 06:10.333
-Okay…
-Don't you remember, Beesh?

06:10.416 --> 06:12.833
You made me laugh so hard that I snorted,

06:12.916 --> 06:15.666
and the potato shot out,
and it landed in your milk.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.833
And now I'm lactose intolerant by choice.

06:18.916 --> 06:21.791
Okay, Harold.

06:21.875 --> 06:25.375
Bubsy gets adopted next week.
How do you want him to remember you?

06:25.458 --> 06:26.791
I…

06:26.875 --> 06:28.583
I-- I kept the potato.

06:28.666 --> 06:31.875
He kept the potato. Cool.

06:31.958 --> 06:37.916
I promise to always surprise you

06:39.666 --> 06:44.583
I promise to always be fun

06:45.833 --> 06:49.875
To be bad to the bone

06:49.958 --> 06:52.750
And you can tell everyone

06:53.541 --> 06:59.583
That I won't stop Until I'm done

07:00.625 --> 07:03.375
We're not like everyone else

07:03.458 --> 07:07.041
There's nobody here
Just like you and me

07:07.125 --> 07:10.458
We're one of a kind
And deep down inside

07:10.541 --> 07:14.166
We're the only ones out here

07:14.250 --> 07:17.750
Who are free

07:17.833 --> 07:21.125
We're the only ones out here

07:21.208 --> 07:28.000
Who are free

07:38.041 --> 07:39.125
Okay, my turn.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.500
So, Bubs, I'm gonna miss
your world-class dancing,

07:43.583 --> 07:46.541
and I'll miss getting
your basketball unstuck

07:46.625 --> 07:48.833
when you throw it in the rafters.

07:48.916 --> 07:52.625
I'll miss tucking you in at night,
and, I don't know,

07:52.708 --> 07:54.791
just watching you grow up

07:54.875 --> 07:58.458
because you're such
a cute little squishy-wishy baby.

08:00.708 --> 08:01.875
What the…

08:09.125 --> 08:10.041
Mr. Napkin!

08:10.125 --> 08:11.583
Help me!

08:29.000 --> 08:31.416
Mr. Napkin! Beesha!

08:31.500 --> 08:32.833
Are you okay?

08:32.916 --> 08:34.875
We're fine, Bubs. We're fine.

08:34.958 --> 08:37.333
What even is that stuff?

08:38.083 --> 08:41.041
I think it's that gross liquid meat
they use to make hot dogs.

08:41.125 --> 08:44.458
Yeah, it's hot dog meat, all right.
The good stuff too.

08:44.541 --> 08:46.083
Well, whatever it is,

08:46.166 --> 08:48.625
I'm glad you didn't drown in it,
Mr. Napkin.

08:48.708 --> 08:53.333
Oh jeez, I forgot to thank you
for saving my life, Beesha.

08:53.416 --> 08:56.708
You know, my mom always told me
I was an ungrateful child

08:56.791 --> 08:59.583
and our family's biggest disappointment.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.333
Anyhow, thank you.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.375
Of course.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.250
The world's a much better place
with you in it, Mr. N.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.833
Shock and outrage in Triperot today

09:09.916 --> 09:14.250
as one of the worst liquid hot dog meat
floods in the nation's history

09:14.333 --> 09:15.750
has citizens reeling.

09:15.833 --> 09:19.208
Oi! Woman! Our prank's on telly!

09:19.291 --> 09:23.541
When I was a little shaver,
Triperot was the fun capital of the world.

09:23.625 --> 09:24.791
We had fun.

09:24.875 --> 09:28.416
Then Tripe Lake dried up,
and I thought things couldn't get worse.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.083
Guess what? News flash. This is way worse.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.416
This is worse.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.166
What I wanna know is,

09:34.250 --> 09:38.000
how the heck can hard-working people
like us get ahead in this town?

09:38.083 --> 09:40.250
I also wanna know that, also as well.

09:40.333 --> 09:41.666
I'm Beverly Onion,

09:41.750 --> 09:45.500
joined now by Triperot Mayor,
Wayne John John-John.

09:45.583 --> 09:49.125
Mayor John-John, do we know
who's behind this savage attack?

09:49.208 --> 09:50.250
Thank you, Beverly.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.541
Number one, as always,

09:52.625 --> 09:54.291
our thoughts and prayers

09:54.375 --> 09:57.750
are with those affected
by this meat-astrophe.

09:57.833 --> 10:00.916
Number two, election day is coming up,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.833
so remember, a vote for John-John
is a vote for fun-fun.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.083
And number three,

10:07.166 --> 10:10.875
those evildoers
may have blown up our water tower,

10:10.958 --> 10:15.875
but they can never blow up
the spirit of this great city.

10:16.458 --> 10:18.166
How can he blame us?

10:18.250 --> 10:21.625
Any reasonable person
would've done exactly the same thing

10:21.708 --> 10:24.333
if they'd had their fun park shut down.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.166
If that bum don't like us
blowing up that water tower,

10:27.250 --> 10:29.875
I say we blow up his butt.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.666
The mayor's butt would eventually explode.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.208
However, we can talk about that later.

10:40.291 --> 10:46.291
For now, the Twits' trick was having
very real consequences for our heroes.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.791
I'm so happy you're going to be my parents

10:48.875 --> 10:52.541
because all I've ever wanted
is-- is to find a family.

10:52.625 --> 10:53.916
Oh, boy.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.291
You're not gonna find a cuter child
in the tristate area, Mr. and Mrs. Klurb.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.541
That's a promise.

11:01.541 --> 11:03.333
Here's the deal, friend.

11:03.416 --> 11:08.125
We've reconsidered, actually,
based on circumstances,

11:08.208 --> 11:11.708
and, uh, you know,
adopting this kid over here, you know,

11:11.791 --> 11:13.875
that's gonna be a no-go for us.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.708
Yeah, we've seen on the news
how certain parts of town

11:16.791 --> 11:20.208
are still finding high levels
of liquid hot dog meat in their pipes.

11:20.791 --> 11:24.666
And then we seen your kids here
drinking that toxic meat water.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.458
Breaks my heart to say it,
but we just don't have the money

11:28.541 --> 11:31.083
to care for a contaminated child.

11:33.958 --> 11:38.083
We've decided to take our business
to another orphanage.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.375
Sorry, bucko.

11:40.458 --> 11:45.208
It's okay, Bubsy, those folks
don't know what they're talking about.

11:45.291 --> 11:48.416
We'll find you a family yet,
I guarantee it.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.708
I'm never gonna get adopted, Beesh.

12:00.791 --> 12:02.166
Yes, you are.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.291
You just have to have hope.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.708
I mean, my dream
is to see my parents again.

12:07.791 --> 12:10.791
Even though I know
they're coming back for me,

12:10.875 --> 12:12.791
it's still hard to wait.

12:13.458 --> 12:17.958
But some incredible family
is gonna find you so soon.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.333
I can feel it.

12:19.416 --> 12:22.833
And until that happens, I got your back.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.375
And your nose.

12:24.458 --> 12:27.041
And your intestines!

12:27.125 --> 12:31.333
You always have everyone's back, Beesh.
And their nose, and their intestines.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.458
I try.

12:32.541 --> 12:34.500
But who takes care of you?

12:35.083 --> 12:37.333
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

12:37.416 --> 12:39.333
I'm 12. Almost.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.083
So, yeah. I'm fine.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.833
But you're not fine.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.666
And this city isn't fine. I just…

12:50.375 --> 12:54.541
I want people to not be
so terrible to each other all the time.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.875
So you know what?

12:55.958 --> 12:58.291
I'm not gonna sit here and wait around

12:58.375 --> 13:01.083
for someone else
to make the world less cruel. Uh-uh.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.166
I'm gonna go out there and follow clues

13:03.250 --> 13:05.791
and find whoever put the meat
in that water tower.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.958
And I am going to bring
those jerks to justice.

13:09.041 --> 13:12.083
Will you shut up?!

13:12.166 --> 13:14.625
We're trying to be quiet here!

13:14.708 --> 13:18.250
How am I supposed to steal
these chemical loos

13:18.333 --> 13:20.958
with all that honking, you baby diaper?

13:29.791 --> 13:32.791
Aren't those the people
from the Twitlandia ad, Beesh?

13:32.875 --> 13:34.791
That's gotta be who did it.

13:34.875 --> 13:38.583
Looks like you're gonna get to go
to Twitlandia after all. Come on.

13:38.666 --> 13:40.708
Whoo-hoo!

13:41.750 --> 13:44.708
I know we're trying
to capture criminals, Beesh,

13:44.791 --> 13:47.625
but I still wanna go on a roller coaster.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.875
There it is. There's the truck.

13:51.416 --> 13:54.166
How have the police not figured this out?

14:01.375 --> 14:02.291
Beesha?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.541
We'll be fine.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.666
Come on.

14:27.750 --> 14:30.958
Twitlandia looked way nicer
in the commercial.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.416
Yeah.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.375
It looks like a place
where children go to be murdered.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.166
But, hey, you can't judge a book
by its cover.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.875
Wait there. I got this.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.666
What do you want?!

15:01.750 --> 15:03.583
Uh… Uh… Um…

15:03.666 --> 15:05.791
Hi. Hello, ma'am. And sir.

15:07.041 --> 15:08.458
What are you doing here?

15:08.541 --> 15:09.916
Oh!

15:10.000 --> 15:11.125
What we are…

15:11.208 --> 15:12.500
…doing here…

15:12.583 --> 15:16.791
…is what I'm about to tell you,
which is that…

15:17.375 --> 15:19.625
we are here to visit Twitlandia?

15:20.125 --> 15:22.500
Oh!

15:23.083 --> 15:25.458
Those stupid little dunces
must not have heard

15:25.541 --> 15:30.041
about all the terrible health code
violations that got us shut down.

15:30.125 --> 15:33.250
We are back in business, woman.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.333
Come along, youngsters.

15:35.416 --> 15:37.166
The fun park's out back.

15:37.250 --> 15:42.166
You know, I couldn't help but notice
that gigantic meat truck parked out front,

15:42.250 --> 15:44.125
and I was wondering if-- What the…?

15:46.791 --> 15:47.875
What is this?

15:47.958 --> 15:50.333
Ha! That's Hugtight Sticky Glue.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.458
Best glue on the market
for capturing birds.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.625
Why would anyone wanna capture birds?

15:58.708 --> 16:01.583
To make bird pie, obviously.

16:01.666 --> 16:03.291
Idiot.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.541
But you didn't come to Twitlandia

16:05.625 --> 16:08.708
to hear my rotten turnip of a wife
call you an idiot.

16:08.791 --> 16:10.458
You came to give us your money!

16:10.541 --> 16:14.083
The Celebrity Diamond Platinum Pass.
That's the one you're gonna want.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.916
That gives you access
to all the best attractions.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.666
Your Tilt-A-Potty, your Pirate's Booty,
the finest entertainments

16:20.750 --> 16:23.750
in the Credenza Twit
Memorial Concert Hall!

16:23.833 --> 16:28.083
That package starts at just $8,500.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.291
I have, like, three bucks.

16:30.375 --> 16:34.333
And I have some baby carrots

16:34.416 --> 16:36.500
and a dirty Band-Aid.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.541
Mm.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.916
Only thing that'll get you
is a frolic about in the bouncy pit.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Wow!

16:46.083 --> 16:51.375
As fun and sanitary as a hole
filled with soiled mattresses looks,

16:51.458 --> 16:54.000
I was really interested
in hearing the story

16:54.083 --> 16:56.458
behind that gigantic meat truck out front.

16:56.541 --> 16:58.500
Oh, that meat truck? We stole it.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.583
Excuse me?

17:00.666 --> 17:02.958
Why? You just rip a greasy fart?

17:03.041 --> 17:07.750
No. I didn't rip a greasy fart.

17:07.833 --> 17:11.208
Uh, I just thought I heard you say
you stole that meat truck?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.250
We did.

17:12.333 --> 17:16.166
Then we put the meat in a water tower
and blew the lot of it up.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.625
But it's not our fault.

17:23.708 --> 17:27.708
We done it to get revenge
on this crummy town.

17:27.791 --> 17:28.708
Wow!

17:28.791 --> 17:31.416
You just said all of those things to us.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.541
Delightful.

17:33.625 --> 17:35.833
Um, we have to be going now.

17:35.916 --> 17:38.250
But we haven't gone on any of the rides.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.041
Next time.

17:45.416 --> 17:47.791
Hey! Be sure and tell your friends.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.791
But only the ones
with more money than you've got!

17:51.875 --> 17:53.916
Come on. I think that's the way out.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.333
There's nothing to be scared of.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.625
Beesh?

18:08.416 --> 18:11.500
What kind of animals are those?

18:19.666 --> 18:22.500
Those poor creatures look so sad.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.833
What do you think they're saying?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.291
-Please help us.
-Help!

18:42.291 --> 18:45.000
Those evil monsters
are holding us against our will.

18:45.083 --> 18:49.208
If there is anything that you can do,
we would be so, so grateful.

18:49.291 --> 18:52.125
I do not like this stinky old cage.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.583
In rare cases…

18:53.666 --> 18:54.500
Beesh?

18:54.583 --> 18:57.333
…very sensitive children
with deep empathy…

18:57.416 --> 18:58.291
Are you…?

18:58.375 --> 19:00.666
…have been known to understand animals.

19:00.750 --> 19:01.833
Yes! Yes, yes!

19:01.916 --> 19:05.041
Wait, can you kids understand
what I'm saying?

19:05.125 --> 19:06.958
Are you hearing us?

19:07.041 --> 19:07.958
Yes!

19:08.041 --> 19:10.000
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

19:10.083 --> 19:13.500
I think I'm gonna pass out! Or maybe barf?

19:13.583 --> 19:17.083
Oh yeah, definitely gonna
glorvin up a florbnorble.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.958
Do not glorvin out
another florbnorble, Marty.

19:20.041 --> 19:22.666
Just breathe and say hello to them.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.541
-Hello!
-Don't shout. They're right there.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.708
I'm sorry, he's overwhelmed right now.

19:27.791 --> 19:31.625
We all are, 'cause just, wow, wow, wow!

19:31.708 --> 19:35.666
It's okay. I can't believe it either.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.916
My name is Beesha,
and this is my friend Bubsy.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.625
I'm Mandy Muggle-Wump,
and my mama is Mary Muggle-Wump,

19:42.708 --> 19:44.791
and my papa is Marty Muggle-Wump.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.875
You can call me Big Daddy if you want.

19:46.958 --> 19:50.125
Don't ask them to call you that, Marty.
Oh, good Lord.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.875
You Muggle-Wumps are funny.

19:52.958 --> 19:57.666
I have a question, and that question is,
do you kids know how to open up cages?

19:57.750 --> 20:00.500
We've been stuck in this thing for years.

20:00.583 --> 20:03.333
There's a key to the lock
somewhere in that house.

20:03.416 --> 20:05.916
If there's any way you could find it?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.916
Of course. We'll find the key
and get you outta there.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.416
I promise.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.416
You should get outta here right now.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.625
What? Why?

20:13.708 --> 20:16.333
-What are you--
-Get away from there!

20:16.416 --> 20:19.583
Them things
is the brown jewel of Twitlandia.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.291
We stole them from Loompaland.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.625
And you lot, get back to crying.

20:27.291 --> 20:29.125
What are you doing to them?

20:29.208 --> 20:31.916
They cry magical tears
when they go upside down,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.208
and them magical tears is the power source

20:34.291 --> 20:36.083
that keeps Twitlandia running.

20:37.541 --> 20:41.000
-We don't got no city power out here.
-I know what you're thinking.

20:41.083 --> 20:44.666
"They're gonna get the Dreaded Shrinks."

20:44.750 --> 20:49.583
No, because we only make them stay
on their heads for one hour at a time.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.875
What are the Dreaded Shrinks?

20:51.958 --> 20:54.166
What do you got, butt cheeks for brains?

20:54.250 --> 20:58.541
The Dreaded Shrinks is what happens
when you stand on your head too long.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.375
We don't need their heads
to shrink into their necks,

21:01.458 --> 21:05.208
their necks to shrink into their bodies,
bodies to shrink into their legs,

21:05.291 --> 21:08.000
till all that's left
is a big puddle of nothing.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.708
You people are evil.

21:11.791 --> 21:14.250
Yeah, well, you're evil.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.083
You two walk away now,

21:16.166 --> 21:20.041
or else my gorgeous wife
will put you in a sumptuous pie

21:20.125 --> 21:22.875
and cook you for our supper!

21:24.333 --> 21:25.416
We'll be back.

21:25.916 --> 21:27.666
Beat it!

21:33.208 --> 21:35.041
Wait, Beesh, wait!

21:37.250 --> 21:40.041
What are we gonna do
about those poor Muggle-Wumps?

21:40.125 --> 21:42.291
Free them when the Twits get arrested.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.375
What do you mean? How?

21:44.458 --> 21:45.291
Hmm…

21:45.375 --> 21:48.291
I might have recorded
every word they said.

21:49.583 --> 21:50.458
What?

21:53.458 --> 21:56.958
I'm Beverly Onion,
reporting live with breaking news.

21:57.041 --> 22:00.125
I'm here with local orphan child,
Beesha Balti,

22:00.208 --> 22:01.958
who brought us stunning footage

22:02.041 --> 22:06.125
that promises to solve
a big Triperot mystery.

22:06.208 --> 22:07.333
Beesha?

22:07.416 --> 22:09.166
Yes, so, um, Miss Onion,

22:09.250 --> 22:12.041
the Triperot Home for Children,
which is where I live,

22:12.125 --> 22:16.291
is still contaminated with meat water,
and no one was doing anything about it,

22:16.375 --> 22:18.708
and my best friend,
Bubsy Mulch, was about--

22:18.791 --> 22:19.958
Good job, Beesha.

22:20.041 --> 22:23.666
Let's take a look
at her shocking hidden-camera footage.

22:25.250 --> 22:27.291
Oh, that meat truck? We stole it.

22:27.375 --> 22:29.083
-Excuse me?
-Why?

22:29.166 --> 22:31.333
-You just rip a greasy fart?
-No…

22:31.416 --> 22:33.375
Woman! We're on the telly!

22:36.541 --> 22:39.875
We did, then we put
the meat in a water tower

22:39.958 --> 22:41.375
and blew the lot of it up!

22:44.666 --> 22:47.208
As you can see, the Twits freely admit

22:47.291 --> 22:50.708
that they committed
this savage, sausagey assault.

22:50.791 --> 22:53.166
Oh! I look so perspirational!

22:53.250 --> 22:55.708
-And I sound like a genius
-Ooh! Uh-oh!

22:55.791 --> 22:57.583
A proper, proper genius

22:57.666 --> 23:01.541
And all the world shall worship me
'Cause I'm a precious genius

23:01.625 --> 23:03.916
Spelled J-E-N-U-A-S

23:04.000 --> 23:06.958
They're already coming
to give me my own TV show.

23:07.041 --> 23:09.250
It's finally happening for us, woman!

23:13.958 --> 23:14.958
Come on, baby.

23:15.041 --> 23:17.291
-This is what you paid to see.
-Ta-da!

23:18.750 --> 23:20.708
What do you think you're do--

23:21.833 --> 23:22.875
Why?

23:23.583 --> 23:25.583
Do you know who I am?

23:25.666 --> 23:27.291
I'm an important celebrity.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.375
I am a genius!

23:29.875 --> 23:31.958
Credenza S. Twit and James T. Twit,

23:32.041 --> 23:34.458
you are under arrest
for deliberately and maliciously

23:34.541 --> 23:37.000
flooding Triperot
with liquid hot dog meat.

23:37.083 --> 23:42.041
Mr. and Mrs. Twit, do you have anything
to say to the citizens of Triperot?

23:42.125 --> 23:43.916
Yeah, I got something to say.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.166
If you people had supported Twitlandia,

23:46.250 --> 23:51.375
then everyone in this stupid town
would've had all their dreams come true!

23:51.458 --> 23:54.583
Triperot could've been
the fun capital of the world again.

23:54.666 --> 23:58.166
And all y'all would've been living
in the lamp of luxury.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.375
You blew it, Triperot!

24:00.458 --> 24:01.666
You blew it!

24:01.750 --> 24:04.708
The city should never
have shut down Twitlandia!

24:04.791 --> 24:07.875
It's the world's
only gosh-dang amusement park!

24:07.958 --> 24:09.166
Don't you hear me?

24:09.250 --> 24:12.125
This is your fault, Mayor John-John!

24:12.208 --> 24:13.458
Stop pushing me!

24:13.541 --> 24:16.250
Did Mrs. Muggle-Wump
say where they keep the key?

24:16.333 --> 24:19.708
Uh-uh. I think we're just
gonna have to look everywhere.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.916
It's creepy in here.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.666
And it smells.

24:27.750 --> 24:30.458
Do either of those things surprise you?

24:30.541 --> 24:31.666
No, not really.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.250
Are these poor animals dead?

24:51.916 --> 24:52.958
Yeah.

24:53.041 --> 24:55.041
They've all been taxidermied.

25:23.458 --> 25:24.500
The heck?

25:26.916 --> 25:29.916
It sounds like it's talking backwards.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.708
Or maybe French?

25:31.791 --> 25:35.875
If you lick my toes,
opposite your life goes.

25:35.958 --> 25:37.166
Okay.

25:41.750 --> 25:44.083
Here, um, I think maybe…

25:44.166 --> 25:46.375
I'm a Sweet-Toed Opposite Toad,

25:46.458 --> 25:50.791
and if you lick my toes,
opposite your life will go.

25:50.875 --> 25:53.708
I've never met a sweet-toed toad before.

25:53.791 --> 25:56.000
Oh! I'm from Loompaland.

25:56.083 --> 25:59.625
I came here with my friends,
the Muggle-Wumps.

25:59.708 --> 26:03.000
We know the Muggle-Wumps.
We're gonna get them outta their cage.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.666
Huh! Please free me too!

26:05.750 --> 26:08.583
Mrs. Twit tried to turn me into taxidermy.

26:08.666 --> 26:11.875
I've been stuck in this room ever since.

26:11.958 --> 26:15.458
And no one in here will lick my toes.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.291
Of course we'll set you free.

26:20.333 --> 26:24.208
You wouldn't happen to know where the key
to the Muggle-Wumps' cage is, would you?

26:24.791 --> 26:27.000
Unfortunately, I don't.

26:27.083 --> 26:30.041
That's okay.
There are lots of things I don't know too.

26:30.125 --> 26:34.000
Like, why don't baby carrots
have to wear diapers?

26:34.083 --> 26:36.833
We've talked about this, Bubs.
They don't have butts.

26:36.916 --> 26:39.916
We'll let you out the front door.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.208
Twits, you made bail.

26:53.750 --> 26:56.375
I can't think who'd pay our bail.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.000
You're the only person I know.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.625
And I don't like you enough
to bail you out.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.583
-There they are.
-They're the ones on TV.

27:05.666 --> 27:09.416
Mr. and Mrs. Twit, you're our only hope!
Love ya!

27:09.500 --> 27:11.041
Huh?

27:11.625 --> 27:12.750
What?

27:14.750 --> 27:16.791
You're probably confused.

27:16.875 --> 27:18.291
I am confused.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.916
That's why I said,
"You're probably confused."

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Oh.

27:22.083 --> 27:23.375
The Twits were too,

27:23.458 --> 27:27.666
but if I told you just a little bit
about the city where they live,

27:27.750 --> 27:29.458
I think it'd make more sense.

27:29.541 --> 27:33.458
Triperot was once
a popular vacation destination,

27:33.541 --> 27:36.583
known as the fun capital of the world.

27:36.666 --> 27:41.083
But when Tripe Lake dried up,
the tourists stopped visiting.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.583
Businesses closed.

27:42.666 --> 27:46.750
People lost their jobs,
their money, their way of life.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.291
Desperate and down on their luck,

27:49.375 --> 27:53.208
many of them were ready to believe
anyone who might offer salvation.

27:53.291 --> 27:56.166
Hey, Dorcas! Supper's ready!

27:56.250 --> 27:57.291
Ah!

27:57.875 --> 28:01.791
Oh, Dorcas. That was our last jar of ham.

28:01.875 --> 28:03.083
Sorry, Mom.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.166
It's all right, hon. Wasn't your fault.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.375
Money's real tight is all, honey.

28:07.458 --> 28:09.500
If you people supported Twitlandia,

28:09.583 --> 28:15.000
then everyone in this stupid town
would've had all their dreams come true!

28:15.083 --> 28:18.291
Triperot could've been
the fun capital of the world again,

28:18.375 --> 28:21.708
and all y'all would've been living
in the lamp of luxury.

28:21.791 --> 28:24.000
The city should never have…

28:24.083 --> 28:26.958
When you very much
want something to be true…

28:27.041 --> 28:27.875
-Huh.
-Hmm.

28:27.958 --> 28:31.583
…it's very easy
to convince yourself that it is.

28:31.666 --> 28:34.458
Hi there, Mr. and Mrs. Twit.
Name's Dee Dumdie-Dungle.

28:34.541 --> 28:37.333
-My bridegroom here--
-Horvis Dungle!

28:37.416 --> 28:38.916
Yeah, that's your name, hon.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.916
He seems to think Twitlandia
could make Triperot

28:42.000 --> 28:43.833
the fun capital of the world again.

28:43.916 --> 28:46.833
And I'm like, "Hmm…"

28:46.916 --> 28:49.000
Yeah, she's always like, "Hmm…"

28:49.083 --> 28:51.083
Uh, but I'm more like, "Hmm!"

28:51.166 --> 28:53.958
So anyhow, uh,
we called a few of our friends

28:54.041 --> 28:55.458
to help bail you guys out.

28:55.541 --> 28:56.833
Yeah.

28:56.916 --> 29:00.333
Because if Twitlandia is for real,
boy, we all want in.

29:00.416 --> 29:02.791
I also want in, also as well.

29:03.458 --> 29:04.416
You hear that?

29:04.500 --> 29:06.333
I do.

29:06.416 --> 29:09.916
I'd say it's high time
we start making some promises

29:10.000 --> 29:12.083
we have no intention of keeping.

29:13.958 --> 29:16.375
Yes, my friends, it's true.

29:16.458 --> 29:19.708
If we reopen Twitlandia,
tourism will return,

29:19.791 --> 29:22.916
Triperot will be
the fun capital of the world again,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.416
and all the city's problems
will be solved.

29:26.500 --> 29:30.541
But none of that can happen
without one little thing.

29:30.625 --> 29:31.666
Your money.

29:31.750 --> 29:36.000
And that is why we've got
a honey of a deal for you.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.125
If you invest just $1,000,

29:39.208 --> 29:42.416
we guarantee you $1 billion

29:42.500 --> 29:44.000
when the park opens.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.208
Holy smokes.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.666
That's a great deal.

29:46.750 --> 29:49.583
Yeah, we can just dip
into Dorcas's college fund.

29:50.208 --> 29:53.583
Uh, Mom, Dad, a moment of your time.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.708
This seems like an obvious lie.

29:56.791 --> 30:00.250
Oh, Dorcas,
you're just too young to understand

30:00.333 --> 30:03.625
that the Twits are going to make
all of our dreams come true!

30:03.708 --> 30:05.541
Oh, thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Twit!

30:05.625 --> 30:07.916
-A billion to you!
-I want a billion!

30:08.000 --> 30:11.833
-A billion for you! Billion! Billion!
-Whoo-hoo!

30:12.958 --> 30:15.541
Our Twitlandia dream is gonna come true.

30:15.625 --> 30:18.333
They love me. They really love me.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.541
-Let me get that for you, lass.
-Ooh!

30:20.625 --> 30:22.375
Whoa!

30:34.333 --> 30:37.750
Ugh. What is it
with these people and toilets?

30:37.833 --> 30:39.916
Maybe they have small bladders

30:40.000 --> 30:42.875
and have to go
in the middle of the night sometimes.

30:42.958 --> 30:43.833
Huh.

30:49.666 --> 30:50.583
Yoo-hoo!

30:50.666 --> 30:54.000
Our big celebration supper's
almost ready, Jimmy.

30:58.458 --> 31:00.083
Mm!

31:01.375 --> 31:05.125
It's a special new kind of spaghetti
for my special guy.

31:05.208 --> 31:08.166
Eat it up now while it's nice and hot.

31:08.250 --> 31:09.583
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.708
Yeah, it-- it's squishy

31:17.791 --> 31:21.000
with a-- with a hint
of distinctly bitter flavor.

31:21.083 --> 31:24.083
You wanna know
why your spaghetti's squishy?

31:25.083 --> 31:25.916
Why?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.166
And why it has a bitter taste?

31:29.041 --> 31:30.083
Why?

31:30.166 --> 31:33.541
Because it's worms! You're eating worms!

31:37.250 --> 31:39.625
Okay.

31:39.708 --> 31:45.250
If I were a key,
I'd hide under a pillow, maybe?

31:47.250 --> 31:49.666
Voice Changer 30,000? What's this…

31:49.750 --> 31:52.708
…thing do? Whoa, that's really weird.

32:07.791 --> 32:08.708
Mm.

32:08.791 --> 32:09.666
Mm.

32:14.291 --> 32:15.583
Was that the Twits?

32:15.666 --> 32:18.708
It can't be.
They've gotta be in jail by now.

32:18.791 --> 32:19.958
It's…

32:20.041 --> 32:22.166
It's been a long day.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.958
I'm tired.

32:24.041 --> 32:26.166
Let's just… …go to bed.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.708
What the…? What's happening?

32:31.708 --> 32:33.541
Oh no! Oh no!

32:39.750 --> 32:41.041
This is not good.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.083
They are home,

32:43.166 --> 32:45.916
and now they're gonna put us
in a pie and eat us.

32:58.625 --> 32:59.750
-Beesh.
-Duck!

33:08.041 --> 33:10.791
We're fine, Bubs. We're fine. We're okay.

33:48.916 --> 33:50.958
Ugh.

33:59.166 --> 34:00.375
The key.

34:09.416 --> 34:10.625
It's in his beard.

34:18.291 --> 34:19.125
Ew.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.291
Blech.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.458
What are you doing, woman?!

34:37.541 --> 34:39.416
Come on. Let's go.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.250
-Hey, what--
-It's them kids.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.375
Go, go, go!

34:46.583 --> 34:47.541
Oh!

34:48.041 --> 34:50.500
We got the key!

34:50.583 --> 34:52.125
We got the key!

34:52.208 --> 34:53.791
-Oh my gosh, really?
-No way!

34:53.875 --> 34:55.708
You guys are my heroes!

34:55.791 --> 34:57.166
Come on. Come on.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.625
I'm gonna put you kids in a pie
and cook you both for supper!

35:00.708 --> 35:02.250
Go. You gotta get out of here.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.000
No way. We're getting you out.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.958
-You can't get us out if you're in a pie.
-Hurry, Beesh!

35:07.041 --> 35:10.458
-Go. Don't let them catch you.
-Those monsters will kill you.

35:10.541 --> 35:13.708
-Don't say "kill." It's negative.
-Come on, Beesh. Hurry.

35:13.791 --> 35:16.041
-Save yourselves.
-Hurry!

35:16.125 --> 35:17.375
Go!

35:17.875 --> 35:19.291
Come on! Come on!

35:22.791 --> 35:24.375
Ha!

35:24.458 --> 35:26.666
-Gotcha.
-Help!

35:38.333 --> 35:39.708
Hey, Mary.

35:39.791 --> 35:41.458
I feel like that's pretty good.

35:41.541 --> 35:43.500
Oh.

35:43.583 --> 35:45.625
Okay, yeah, one more. Just one more.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.416
Come on, let's go!

35:52.458 --> 35:53.791
Come on! Come on!

36:00.583 --> 36:03.583
They're stealing our stolen Muggle-Wumps!

36:10.166 --> 36:15.750
Rainbows are gettin' back in style

36:16.875 --> 36:18.250
Cripes!

36:18.333 --> 36:20.458
Hi, Mr. Napkin. Everything's fine.

36:20.541 --> 36:24.541
Whatever you do,
do not open the door for the Twits.

36:24.625 --> 36:27.416
You got it, Beesha.
Don't open the door for the Twits.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.958
Welcome to the Triperot Home for Children.

36:33.041 --> 36:34.416
What can I do you for?

36:34.500 --> 36:35.833
Where are they?

36:35.916 --> 36:37.083
Where are who?

36:37.666 --> 36:39.125
Are you trying to be funny?

36:39.208 --> 36:40.375
No, I doubt it.

36:40.458 --> 36:44.250
My mom always told me
I was a uniquely humorless child.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.333
Anyhow, I'm Burl Napkin.

36:47.458 --> 36:51.291
And whatever it is you need,
I'm sure we can fellowship about it

36:51.375 --> 36:53.791
like reasonable adults
over a hot beef loaf

36:53.875 --> 36:55.458
and some spray cheese.

36:58.291 --> 37:01.666
Beesha, he let them in,
and he offered them cheese!

37:01.750 --> 37:03.666
We're all gonna die!

37:03.750 --> 37:06.125
No one's gonna die, Harold.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.416
Just nobody panic.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.750
But Harold told us to panic.

37:09.833 --> 37:11.833
-Tuna, Harold, get the blocks.
-Huh?

37:11.916 --> 37:14.166
Everybody else, cardboard and crayons now.

37:14.250 --> 37:15.375
You got it.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.250
Oh, boy.

37:27.750 --> 37:32.666
Uh, so, um, what exactly
can I help you with, Mr. and Mrs. Twit?

37:32.750 --> 37:35.125
Your no-good children
stole our Muggle-Wumps.

37:35.208 --> 37:37.125
Sorry, my who stole your what?

37:37.208 --> 37:41.083
The creatures whose tears
are the power source for our fun park.

37:41.166 --> 37:44.291
You know we can't run Twitlandia
without the Muggle-Wumps.

37:44.375 --> 37:47.458
Yeah, see, I'm hearing words
come out of your mouth,

37:47.541 --> 37:50.791
but I'm not comprehending
their-- their meaning.

37:50.875 --> 37:55.125
If you won't hand over our Muggle-Wumps,
you're gonna have to pay us.

37:55.208 --> 37:59.125
Those animals is worth $1 billion.

37:59.208 --> 38:02.250
Oh, I'm a bit cash poor at the moment.

38:02.333 --> 38:04.958
Um, my investments
are primarily emotional.

38:05.041 --> 38:07.916
In that case,
give us some of your possessions.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.166
We'll take, mm,

38:10.250 --> 38:14.125
the shoes, the shirt,
the slacks, and… the watch.

38:14.208 --> 38:17.208
But this watch belonged to my late father.

38:17.291 --> 38:21.375
If he was late,
it mustn't have been a very good watch.

38:21.458 --> 38:22.375
Come on.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.708
Don't come back, or we'll take the briefs.

38:25.791 --> 38:27.458
Hey! And the sock!

38:28.500 --> 38:31.875
Well, glad I decided
to put on briefs this morning.

38:32.458 --> 38:35.000
Rainbows are coming back in--

38:36.166 --> 38:38.000
Oh, right back at you. Toot-toot!

38:38.083 --> 38:39.875
-Get a job!
-Oh, jeez.

38:40.500 --> 38:43.000
Mr. Napkin got tricked
out of his pants again!

38:43.083 --> 38:47.250
Of course he did.
Come on, everyone. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

38:52.916 --> 38:54.750
Okay. Okay.

38:58.958 --> 39:01.166
-Hurry, Harold.
-Let's go! Come on!

39:11.958 --> 39:14.166
Action positions now!

39:23.375 --> 39:26.458
Go on.
That burning sensation in your chest…

39:27.458 --> 39:28.291
…is natural.

39:28.375 --> 39:32.750
-Okay, you brats. We want what's ours.
-Thank goodness you're here.

39:32.833 --> 39:36.500
-They went right through that door.
-They're sneaky little critters.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.833
-Ooh!
-Move it! What are you waiting for?

39:57.125 --> 39:58.125
Gotta admit…

39:58.208 --> 40:01.041
…that trick was pretty brilliant.

40:01.125 --> 40:02.291
And professional.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.375
Ouch!

40:04.333 --> 40:05.666
Are you okay?

40:05.750 --> 40:07.708
You little sneaks!

40:07.791 --> 40:09.625
I gotta lock the door.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.833
Sorry about that. That's on me.

40:21.208 --> 40:23.083
Here I go again, bumbling Burl.

40:40.375 --> 40:43.708
Hey, little girl. Little girl?

40:43.791 --> 40:45.791
Mm, you're good.

40:45.875 --> 40:47.625
You're very good.

40:47.708 --> 40:50.583
You tricked us with your hidden camera.
Got us locked up.

40:50.666 --> 40:52.625
Then stole our stolen Muggle-Wumps.

40:52.708 --> 40:55.166
Then you tricked us
with that pretend door.

40:55.250 --> 40:59.375
You are a Twit in the making,
is what you are.

40:59.458 --> 41:00.708
Really?

41:00.791 --> 41:04.291
Yeah, which is why we have
a very special offer for you.

41:04.375 --> 41:06.375
It's on the up and up. No tricks.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.583
We're backing away. See?

41:12.208 --> 41:14.291
Don't even think about trusting them.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.958
I won't. I got this.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.041
I'm fine.

41:19.916 --> 41:23.458
So, what's this special offer? Hmm?

41:24.208 --> 41:27.166
We would like to adapt you.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.708
To "adapt" me?

41:30.791 --> 41:34.625
Yeah, you know, make you our very own
precious little baby daughter child.

41:34.708 --> 41:37.708
All you gotta do
is give us back the Muggle-Wumps.

41:37.791 --> 41:42.791
Then we can open up our fun park,
become a happy family, the whole deal.

41:42.875 --> 41:43.875
Huh?

41:44.458 --> 41:46.041
Yeah…

41:46.125 --> 41:47.083
No.

41:48.916 --> 41:52.291
Hey, a kid like you ought to be glad
someone wants you,

41:52.375 --> 41:56.250
after being dumped here
like a plate of moldy leftovers.

42:03.125 --> 42:06.958
I wasn't dumped here.
My parents are coming back for me.

42:08.708 --> 42:10.791
She thinks they're coming back!

42:13.166 --> 42:15.583
That's the funniest thing
I've heard in ages!

42:15.666 --> 42:21.125
Thing is, kid, I was abandoned
at the circus by my deadbeat parents.

42:21.208 --> 42:25.125
And mine abandoned me at a bowling alley.

42:25.208 --> 42:29.333
So you see, you really is just like us.

42:29.416 --> 42:33.000
Only smaller and less intelligent.

42:33.083 --> 42:36.000
-I will never be like you.
-Oh…

42:36.083 --> 42:40.250
I am never giving up the Muggle-Wumps,
and this orphanage is owned by Triperot.

42:40.333 --> 42:42.958
So unless you're the stinking mayor,

42:43.041 --> 42:45.416
I suggest you keep out!

42:53.833 --> 42:57.916
Here she is, the greatest dancer
in the history of Loompaland,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.083
Mandy Muggle-Wump!

43:05.958 --> 43:07.666
Our first night of freedom.

43:07.750 --> 43:10.958
I am so snozzing happy, I could just…

43:11.041 --> 43:12.416
Wa-hoo!

43:14.375 --> 43:15.333
Yes!

43:17.250 --> 43:18.416
The heck?

43:18.500 --> 43:20.333
Oh, do humans not glow?

43:20.416 --> 43:23.625
I mean, obviously you don't
when your tears are being harvested

43:23.708 --> 43:26.250
to power an amusement park
because, like, duh.

43:26.333 --> 43:28.416
But otherwise, you glow, right?

43:28.500 --> 43:30.083
I don't think I glow.

43:30.166 --> 43:32.583
Huh. Well, learn something new every day.

43:32.666 --> 43:33.958
Mama!

43:36.875 --> 43:38.083
Whee!

43:42.083 --> 43:44.208
Go, Harold! Go, Harold!

43:52.666 --> 43:54.833
Don't let the Twits get into your head.

43:55.458 --> 43:57.750
You got us out of that cage, Beesha.

43:57.833 --> 43:58.958
We won.

44:01.625 --> 44:02.458
Yeah!

44:03.916 --> 44:05.583
Beesha! We're free!

44:05.666 --> 44:07.166
Come on, dance with me!

44:07.250 --> 44:09.375
We're free!

44:11.458 --> 44:14.916
While the children
and the Muggle-Wumps celebrated,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
the Twits schemed,

44:17.083 --> 44:19.958
cooking up a trick that,
in the coming days,

44:20.041 --> 44:23.250
would have truly explosive consequences

44:23.333 --> 44:27.250
for the city of Triperot
and for our heroes.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.875
-My detractors say I'm soft on crime.
-Ooh!

44:30.958 --> 44:32.666
They say I tanked the economy.

44:32.750 --> 44:35.375
Well, I say I'm running unopposed.

44:35.458 --> 44:37.083
So when you vote for mayor,

44:37.166 --> 44:40.500
just remember, a vote for John-John
is a vote for fun-fun.

44:41.500 --> 44:44.291
Mary! Get in here right now!

44:44.375 --> 44:46.500
Please hurry!

44:46.583 --> 44:49.458
Look, they've got this window
that looks into a world

44:49.541 --> 44:52.833
where a little tiny man
gets handed a stick by another man

44:52.916 --> 44:54.416
who whacks this white circle.

44:54.500 --> 44:58.500
And all these tiny people
who live in this little world, they clap.

44:58.583 --> 45:00.125
Hey, good hit, buddy!

45:00.208 --> 45:01.791
That's a game called golf.

45:01.875 --> 45:04.083
Yeah, and this is a TV, Mr. M.

45:04.166 --> 45:07.166
You can change channels
and watch all kinds of stuff.

45:07.250 --> 45:10.833
-Ooh!
-Welcome to the Triperot mayoral debate.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.666
I'm Beverly Onion.

45:12.750 --> 45:17.583
In addition to previously unopposed
Mayor Wayne John John-John,

45:17.666 --> 45:20.666
we have two last-minute additions
to the race.

45:20.750 --> 45:24.375
-Mrs. Credenza Twit and Mr. Jim Twit.
-Ah!

45:24.458 --> 45:26.000
The economy, crime…

45:26.083 --> 45:28.916
The Twits are running for mayor?

45:30.416 --> 45:34.875
Oh boy, that doesn't seem
like it's good for anybody.

45:47.458 --> 45:48.291
Whee!

45:52.916 --> 45:56.583
-What the heck?
-My daddy barfs up stress balls sometimes.

45:57.125 --> 45:58.666
Okay.

45:58.750 --> 46:01.833
I mean, the scientific term
is to glorvin up a florbnorble.

46:01.916 --> 46:05.166
It's something that happens when I…
…get a little anxious.

46:05.250 --> 46:06.333
Don't worry, Mr. M.

46:06.416 --> 46:09.541
Grown-ups are dumb,
but not dumb enough to vote for a Twit.

46:09.625 --> 46:11.625
Thanks for coming to my rebate.

46:11.708 --> 46:15.125
I gotta run to the bathroom.
I'll be back in a sec, Bub.

46:15.208 --> 46:17.125
I'll be the king of Triperot.

46:17.208 --> 46:20.458
So I'm gonna speak first,
and you're gonna be last to listen.

46:20.541 --> 46:24.583
Mr. Twit, what will you do
if you become mayor of Triperot?

46:24.666 --> 46:28.666
Glad you asked.
Let me show you my diarrhea.

46:30.125 --> 46:31.208
Excuse me?

46:31.291 --> 46:34.375
I made a diarrhea,
and I wanna show it to you.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.125
Please don't.

46:36.208 --> 46:38.708
I have this diarrhea.

46:39.291 --> 46:41.041
-Diorama.
-What?

46:41.125 --> 46:43.375
"I have this diorama."

46:43.875 --> 46:45.333
That's disgusting,

46:45.416 --> 46:48.541
and a secret best kept between you,
your bum, and the toilet.

46:49.958 --> 46:52.958
Now this is a diarrhea

46:53.041 --> 46:55.625
of the world's
number-one fun park, Twitlandia.

46:56.625 --> 47:00.458
Mr. Twit just loves
to talk about his diarrhea.

47:00.541 --> 47:02.416
But what he won't talk about

47:02.500 --> 47:05.583
is how Twitlandia can't reopen
without our Muggle-Wumps,

47:05.666 --> 47:07.666
which were stole by this child.

47:08.666 --> 47:11.958
When I'm mayor,
I'll get them Muggle-Wumps back,

47:12.041 --> 47:15.750
turn Triperot into the fun capital
of the world again,

47:15.833 --> 47:19.958
and make everyone
who votes for me a billionaire!

47:20.041 --> 47:22.333
I love you, Mrs. Twit.

47:22.416 --> 47:24.458
I love you also as well.

47:24.541 --> 47:26.000
People, please.

47:26.083 --> 47:28.958
Do you really think
these so-called Muggle-Wumps

47:29.041 --> 47:31.625
can make Triperot
the fun capital of the world?

47:31.708 --> 47:33.583
I don't.

47:33.666 --> 47:34.916
In fact, if you ask me,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.541
there's only one candidate
who knows a thing or two about fun-fun,

47:38.625 --> 47:40.500
and his name is John-John.

47:40.583 --> 47:45.041
Then how come that candidate
ain't eaten any of that Triperot cake?

47:45.125 --> 47:46.500
Uh, what?

47:46.583 --> 47:49.000
Give it here. I'll eat the cake myself,

47:49.083 --> 47:52.208
if only to prove I care
more about Triperot than he does.

47:52.291 --> 47:53.708
Oh, please.

47:53.791 --> 47:57.458
These good folks know
I live and breathe Triperot.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.291
Now… I eat it too!

48:04.833 --> 48:07.541
Oh yeah! He's eating the cake!

48:07.625 --> 48:09.458
He must really love Triperot.

48:09.541 --> 48:11.375
Yum!

48:14.958 --> 48:17.041
Triperot! Whoo!

48:18.791 --> 48:20.333
Stop this debate!

48:20.416 --> 48:23.708
-Who's that?
-It's that kid who stole the Muggle-Wumps!

48:23.791 --> 48:25.708
-Boo!
-Oh, please don't.

48:25.791 --> 48:28.583
Actually, I freed the Muggle-Wumps.

48:28.666 --> 48:32.958
And I am never,
ever letting the Twits take them back.

48:33.041 --> 48:34.666
What is she doing?

48:34.750 --> 48:37.833
I thought she was
in the bathroom a really long time.

48:37.916 --> 48:38.958
Whee!

48:39.041 --> 48:42.750
See? She admits it.
She ain't giving back them Muggle-Wumps

48:42.833 --> 48:45.250
'cause she don't give a care
about you people.

48:45.333 --> 48:46.458
Oh.

48:46.541 --> 48:50.041
Coming from the people who contaminated
Triperot with hot dog meat?

48:50.708 --> 48:56.375
Which we would do again
if it would help save this wonderful city.

48:56.458 --> 48:58.000
That doesn't even make sense.

48:58.083 --> 48:59.875
You don't make sense.

48:59.958 --> 49:01.583
But you know what does?

49:01.666 --> 49:05.541
A little of the old razzle-dazzle.

49:07.708 --> 49:08.750
What the…

49:08.833 --> 49:10.916
If we had what she stole

49:11.000 --> 49:12.583
Why are you singing?

49:12.666 --> 49:16.333
Then the park would be open

49:16.416 --> 49:17.416
Huh?

49:17.500 --> 49:19.750
We'd all be so happy

49:19.833 --> 49:20.916
Yeah!

49:21.000 --> 49:24.166
But now the whole thing is broken

49:24.250 --> 49:25.583
Excuse me?

49:25.666 --> 49:28.041
Now, I don't need to tell you

49:28.125 --> 49:30.083
No. What's happening?

49:30.166 --> 49:32.416
We made a promise to everyone

49:32.500 --> 49:33.958
Your promises are lies!

49:34.041 --> 49:36.541
A billion dollars

49:36.625 --> 49:37.833
That's a good deal.

49:37.916 --> 49:40.875
It's not our fault That now it is gone

49:40.958 --> 49:41.791
Help.

49:41.875 --> 49:45.958
So now it seems that there's a problem

49:46.041 --> 49:47.291
Oh my, oh my

49:47.375 --> 49:49.291
Now what should we do?

49:49.375 --> 49:50.333
It's not true!

49:50.416 --> 49:53.541
The thief is pointing
Her finger at us, but…

49:53.625 --> 49:54.458
Yeah!

49:54.541 --> 49:59.125
-Oh, the problem is you
-Oh, the problem is you

49:59.208 --> 50:00.208
It's you

50:00.291 --> 50:01.916
It's you, you, you

50:02.000 --> 50:03.416
I don't feel so good.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.333
It's you

50:04.416 --> 50:06.000
It's you, you, you

50:06.083 --> 50:07.250
It's you

50:07.333 --> 50:08.291
It's you

50:08.375 --> 50:10.125
It's you, you, you

50:10.208 --> 50:11.333
It's you

50:11.416 --> 50:12.750
It's you

50:12.833 --> 50:14.541
It's you, you, you

50:14.625 --> 50:18.416
It's you, it's you, it's you, you

50:18.500 --> 50:21.125
-It's you
-We want Twitlandia!

50:21.208 --> 50:22.875
Give back the Muggle-Wumps!

50:22.958 --> 50:24.041
It's you

50:24.125 --> 50:25.041
It's you

50:25.125 --> 50:26.958
It's you, you, you

50:27.041 --> 50:29.083
It's you

50:29.166 --> 50:31.041
Oh, I feel like something's going on…

50:31.125 --> 50:33.500
It's you

50:33.583 --> 50:35.250
It's you, you, you

50:35.333 --> 50:36.250
It's you

50:36.333 --> 50:37.208
It's you

50:37.291 --> 50:39.708
It's you, you, you

50:40.750 --> 50:45.125
A vote for John-John
is a vote for fun-fun!

50:51.833 --> 50:55.666
It burns! It burns!

51:01.458 --> 51:04.208
Uh, Mum, did that man's--?

51:04.291 --> 51:05.166
It did, love.

51:05.666 --> 51:07.500
His bottom exploded.

51:09.166 --> 51:10.208
Oh.

51:18.250 --> 51:19.625
What happens next?

51:22.291 --> 51:25.041
Here, Papa. Drink some gerbil tea.

51:25.125 --> 51:27.125
It'll calm you right down.

51:34.208 --> 51:37.041
Bubsy, is there any sign of her out there?

51:37.125 --> 51:39.875
Not yet. Do you see her, Mrs. M?

51:39.958 --> 51:41.166
Ah, there she is.

51:41.250 --> 51:42.375
Beesha!

51:46.791 --> 51:47.958
Beesha!

51:48.625 --> 51:50.875
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

51:50.958 --> 51:53.166
Beesha's back! She's okay!

51:53.250 --> 51:55.916
You're not fine.
Look at you, you're shaking.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.708
I'll admit it was a lot to have the Twits
blame me for ruining an entire town,

52:00.791 --> 52:03.541
and then to have
a bunch of adults angry-sing at me,

52:03.625 --> 52:06.666
and then to be present
when a man's butt exploded.

52:06.750 --> 52:08.708
But otherwise, I'm…

52:08.791 --> 52:10.291
What--

52:10.375 --> 52:12.708
What happened here? You have a cut.

52:13.291 --> 52:14.791
It's nothing. I'm fine.

52:14.875 --> 52:16.208
Ugh, so help me, child,

52:16.291 --> 52:20.416
if you say "I'm fine" one more time,
I'll have to chew your elbows off.

52:21.666 --> 52:24.583
What, you think I'm kidding?
Look at these teeth.

52:24.666 --> 52:26.541
Here.

52:26.625 --> 52:27.916
Let me clean that up.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.500
Whoa! What the…

52:30.250 --> 52:31.375
Oh, calm down.

52:31.458 --> 52:34.041
Muggle-Wump slobber
has healing properties.

52:48.875 --> 52:51.708
-Huh. Will you look at that?
-What?

52:51.791 --> 52:55.875
You just let somebody help you,
and the world is still turning.

52:55.958 --> 52:58.333
Ha-ha.

52:58.416 --> 53:02.041
Why do you feel like
you have to do everything by yourself?

53:03.583 --> 53:06.375
I lie awake for hours every night

53:06.458 --> 53:08.916
thinking about all the things
I haven't fixed.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.166
I haven't gotten Bubsy adopted.
I haven't stopped the Twits.

53:12.250 --> 53:15.083
-Beesha, it's not your job to--
-I know. I know.

53:15.750 --> 53:20.708
But I feel like if I can prove
that I'm really worth something,

53:20.791 --> 53:22.916
that maybe somehow…

53:23.000 --> 53:26.833
I know it doesn't make any sense,
but maybe somehow,

53:26.916 --> 53:29.708
my parents will hear
about what a good kid I am,

53:29.791 --> 53:34.666
and maybe they'll finally love me enough
to want to come back for me.

53:39.083 --> 53:40.875
It's silly, I know.

53:41.583 --> 53:42.958
It's not silly.

53:43.458 --> 53:46.625
Did you ever think that maybe
they left you here

53:46.708 --> 53:48.125
because they did love you,

53:48.208 --> 53:51.750
and for whatever reason,
they just couldn't take care of you?

53:53.583 --> 53:54.500
Well, anyway,

53:54.583 --> 53:58.000
there are gobs of us
who love you unconditionally,

53:58.083 --> 54:03.958
and who will devour your elbows
if you try to go it alone again.

54:07.541 --> 54:08.541
Whoa.

54:11.083 --> 54:13.708
Well, I should get the kids to bed.

54:13.791 --> 54:18.375
After the day you've had,
why don't you let me take care of that?

54:18.875 --> 54:22.041
My mama and papa
are from this magical island

54:22.125 --> 54:23.416
called Loompaland,

54:23.500 --> 54:26.875
which is the most violentest place
in the whole world.

54:26.958 --> 54:30.291
And my mama's mama
used to sing her this lullaby

54:30.375 --> 54:35.125
about monsters eating your face off
and ripping out your guts and stuff.

54:35.208 --> 54:37.958
It's my very most favorite one.

54:38.041 --> 54:41.000
The world is red

54:41.083 --> 54:44.291
In tooth and claw

54:44.375 --> 54:46.750
Jaws that bite

54:46.833 --> 54:49.791
And teeth that gnaw

54:50.291 --> 54:52.708
Hear their screams

54:52.791 --> 54:55.791
Their cries and roars

54:56.666 --> 54:59.250
Our lives are nasty

54:59.333 --> 55:02.333
Brutish and short

55:04.708 --> 55:08.833
But in dreams you are safe

55:08.916 --> 55:11.916
In dreams you are free

55:12.000 --> 55:14.250
In that beautiful place

55:14.333 --> 55:17.833
Close your eyes and you'll see

55:17.916 --> 55:20.708
The flowers that smile

55:20.791 --> 55:26.458
The sun, it will shine

55:26.541 --> 55:33.000
And nothing can hurt you now

55:35.541 --> 55:38.000
In dreams you are safe

55:38.083 --> 55:40.875
In dreams you are free

55:40.958 --> 55:44.000
In that beautiful place

55:44.083 --> 55:47.000
Close your eyes and you'll see

55:47.083 --> 55:49.958
The flowers that smile

55:50.041 --> 55:55.625
The sun, it will shine

55:55.708 --> 56:01.708
And nothing can hurt you now

56:19.500 --> 56:21.375
I'm in a box and I can't get out!

56:27.916 --> 56:29.541
Ready…

56:30.416 --> 56:31.416
Aim…

56:31.500 --> 56:33.125
Hey, what are you doing?

56:33.208 --> 56:34.250
Fire!

56:36.583 --> 56:38.291
Stop it!

56:38.375 --> 56:40.125
As mayors of Triperot,

56:40.208 --> 56:45.083
we is declaring war on you
and your stupid orphan-anage.

56:45.166 --> 56:47.375
You aren't the mayors of Triperot.

56:47.458 --> 56:48.458
Oh yes, we are.

56:48.541 --> 56:52.541
Wayne John "the Buttless Wonder" John-John
lost the election,

56:52.625 --> 56:55.375
and me and Mr. Twit
got the same number of votes,

56:55.458 --> 56:58.291
so this knotheaded town made us co-mayors.

56:58.375 --> 57:03.458
As evidenced by this totally genuine,
not homemade crown,

57:03.541 --> 57:06.666
and these majestical golden slippers.

57:06.750 --> 57:10.125
Ooh! Now give us
our Muggle-Wumps back this instant!

57:15.666 --> 57:19.208
-I'm really scared.
-There's nothing to be scared of--

57:19.291 --> 57:21.583
Mandy.

57:21.666 --> 57:23.291
Fire!

57:23.375 --> 57:26.625
Go up to the roof.
You can escape, and they won't see you.

57:26.708 --> 57:29.458
And what, let them hurt you kids? Uh-uh.

57:29.958 --> 57:33.375
You were there for us.
We are not going to abandon you.

57:34.125 --> 57:37.708
I know we can beat them
if we work together.

57:37.791 --> 57:38.875
Yeah.

57:42.916 --> 57:45.750
Some might be
more useful than others, but…

57:45.833 --> 57:48.833
Wait, Mr. M,
how many of those things can you…

57:48.916 --> 57:51.083
Is "make" the right word?

57:51.166 --> 57:52.166
Hmm.

57:52.250 --> 57:55.375
Time's up, you swazzly little swamp rats!

57:55.458 --> 57:58.333
For the good of Triperot
and the good of Twitlandia,

57:58.416 --> 58:00.125
go get our Muggle-Wumps!

58:01.666 --> 58:03.208
Give us those Muggle-Wumps!

58:03.291 --> 58:05.916
I also want the Muggle-Wumps also as well!

58:06.000 --> 58:09.333
Mom, Dad, this is not a nice thing to do!

58:09.416 --> 58:11.541
I want those Muggle-Wumps. I need 'em.

58:12.750 --> 58:16.083
Ready, aim, fire!

58:19.875 --> 58:21.166
Fire!

58:22.583 --> 58:24.291
Snakes. Spiders. Dentists.

58:24.375 --> 58:25.583
-Mimes.
-Creepy clowns.

58:25.666 --> 58:26.666
Vermicious Knids.

58:26.750 --> 58:27.958
Bubblegum in your hair.

58:28.041 --> 58:30.125
Forgetting pants when you go to school.

58:30.208 --> 58:33.458
I'm just… I'm… I'm having anxiety
about my anxiety.

58:33.541 --> 58:37.958
You know what gives me anxiety, Marty?
The thought of going back in that cage.

58:57.291 --> 58:58.708
What in the…?

59:03.458 --> 59:06.125
-Thank you for your service!
-Whee!

59:07.416 --> 59:08.666
Whee!

59:26.500 --> 59:28.583
What on earth are these things?

59:28.666 --> 59:31.416
Get back here!
Nobody told you you could leave.

59:31.500 --> 59:32.708
Cowards!

59:32.791 --> 59:34.458
-Touchdown!
-Yes!

59:34.541 --> 59:35.916
Yes!

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Beesha!

59:37.083 --> 59:38.208
What is it, Bub?

59:42.125 --> 59:44.708
Mr. Napkin, don't let them in!

59:45.541 --> 59:47.416
Get out of the way, Crapkin.

59:47.500 --> 59:50.875
We know our Muggle-Wumps are here,
so let us in.

59:50.958 --> 59:52.666
Let you in, huh?

59:53.666 --> 59:55.000
Nah.

59:56.750 --> 59:59.333
-I don't think we'll be doing that today.
-Hmm?

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:19.041
If you think you're getting
into this orphanage,

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:21.625
I say, not on my watch.

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:24.208
Mostly because you took my watch,

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.375
but anyhoo…

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:28.916
…not on my watch!

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:35.791
This ain't over.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:37.666
Oh, I think it is.

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:42.541
We'll be back.

01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:46.458
Whoo! Napkin for the Nap-win! Ah!

01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:48.166
Wow, Mr. Napkin!

01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:52.583
Mr. Napkin.

01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:55.375
Did you lick the Sweet-Toed Toad's toes?

01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:58.000
I… I guess I did.

01:00:58.083 --> 01:01:00.875
I mean, I'd never had a toad
talk to me before.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:03.333
I heard him
and thought it sounded interesting,

01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:05.458
so I-- I licked the toes.

01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:08.791
And as soon as I did,
I suddenly felt real crabby.

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:11.666
-And powerful.
-Kind of like the opposite of yourself?

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.000
Well, yeah, I guess that about sums it up.

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:15.250
That makes sense.

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:17.416
He's an Opposite Toad from Loompaland.

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:21.125
Turmoil in Triperot tonight,

01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:24.000
as former mayor Wayne John John-John

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:27.625
recovers from emergency
butt replacement surgery.

01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:31.041
Meanwhile, Triperot's new mayors,
Credenza and Jim Twit,

01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:35.416
declared war
on some local orphan children and lost.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.583
The victorious youngsters have
one brave orphan to thank,

01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:40.833
Beesha Balti.

01:01:40.916 --> 01:01:43.416
The Muggle-Wump family
is under my protection.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.041
So as long as I'm here,

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:47.541
the Twits will never set foot
in this orphanage,

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:50.916
and Twitlandia will never ever open.

01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:58.541
That little brat's ruining our lives!

01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:05.958
What in God's name
are you doing down there?

01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:08.000
I'm playing with me diarrhea.

01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:11.083
You think squishing your face
around in diarrhea's

01:02:11.166 --> 01:02:13.750
somehow gonna bring
them Muggle-Wumps back?

01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:15.791
You know how that kid operates.

01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:17.708
She's wily like a sea bass.

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:20.500
She ain't never gonna let us
get into that orphanage.

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:23.791
Oh, you poor, pointless, old wombat.

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:27.375
Who said anything about going in?

01:02:36.291 --> 01:02:40.708
Come on. Enough cleaning, Beesha.
Everyone else is asleep up there.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:43.250
I'm honestly not really tired.

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:45.500
So I might as well take the first watch.

01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:49.666
All right, but if you wanna keep
those elbows, repeat after me.

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:52.583
"I will sound the alarm
if I see the Twits,

01:02:52.666 --> 01:02:56.041
and no matter what,
I will not go it alone."

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:58.000
I won't go it alone,

01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:02.458
and I promise, promise, promise
I'll sound the alarm if I see them.

01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:03.708
My heart is a door,

01:03:03.791 --> 01:03:07.083
and my love goes out
into the world through that heart door.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:09.458
Uh, what?

01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:12.291
Oh, no, you're supposed
to repeat after me too.

01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.041
I think I'm good.

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:16.166
Okay, well maybe just do this.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:19.083
My heart door will stay open

01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:22.208
to accept the love of others.

01:03:24.916 --> 01:03:27.916
My heart door will stay open
to accept the love of others.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.666
Because I deserve to be loved.

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:45.541
Because I… deserve to be loved.

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:07.375
Hello?

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.375
Beesha, you won't believe it!

01:04:09.458 --> 01:04:11.583
Mr. Napkin? Uh, where are you?

01:04:11.666 --> 01:04:13.166
I'm with your parents.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.333
Uh…

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:16.833
-What?
-Yeah, they saw you on the news.

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.875
They really wanna meet you.

01:04:19.791 --> 01:04:21.416
I'm with them right now,

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.375
out at the bowling alley
on Tripecrest Road.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.583
They seem like real decent folks, Beesha.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:30.333
They really do.

01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:40.125
Don't, Beesha! Don't!
It's a trick, isn't it?

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:42.750
Tell me she's not falling for this, Mum.

01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:44.583
I can't tell you that.

01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:49.250
Remember, when you desperately
want something to be true…

01:04:49.333 --> 01:04:52.166
It's easy to convince yourself that it is,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.291
even if it's not.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:57.708
Mom! Dad!

01:04:57.791 --> 01:04:58.916
I'm here!

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:01.416
I can't believe you came back.

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:11.208
Ican'tbelieve you came back.

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:15.125
They're never coming back.

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:27.500
I can't believe she fell for it.

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:31.291
The Voice Changer 30,000…
…comes through again.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:34.416
I knew if you heard
that potato-brained Napkin's voice,

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.833
you'd believe anything.

01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:39.708
And you did.

01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:42.625
Now let's go get our Muggle-Wumps.

01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:54.250
No! No, no, no!

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:00.500
Hmm.

01:06:20.958 --> 01:06:23.166
Uh, what's happening?

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.166
Is this an earthquake? Where's Beesha?

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.708
Come on, Twitheads!

01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:32.833
With the proper mob mentality,
we can move mountains!

01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:35.875
Heave-ho now! Heave-ho!

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.750
Heave-ho!

01:06:38.791 --> 01:06:40.208
Heave-ho!

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:45.625
Ho!

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:47.083
Heave-ho!

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.041
It's glued shut!

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:55.166
So is this one. We're trapped!

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.750
Heave-ho!

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:06.708
Mama!

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.500
Help! Help!

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:22.666
Heave-ho!

01:07:33.958 --> 01:07:35.875
Hey! Wait for me!

01:07:40.916 --> 01:07:42.208
Yee-haw!

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:47.583
Next stop, Twitlandia!

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.208
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:59.208
What happened? How?

01:08:00.916 --> 01:08:03.083
Mrs. M? Bubsy?

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.416
Mr. Napkin?

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.458
Is anyone here?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.083
What did I do?

01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:15.875
What did I do?

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:18.250
How could you fall for that, you idiot?

01:08:18.333 --> 01:08:20.125
Idiot. Idiot.

01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:23.875
I hate them. I hate the Twits so much!

01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:30.125
Ow.

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:32.458
What-- What happened? How was…?

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:37.416
The Twits stole the orphanage.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.500
I tried to stop them,
but a woman kicked me with denim boots.

01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:43.166
Didn't even break her stride.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.458
I grabbed hold of her denim boot.

01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:47.916
She shook me once, tried to stomp on me.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.416
Oh, the shame.

01:08:50.166 --> 01:08:52.291
I got kicked by a denim boot.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:54.416
This is all my fault.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.333
I was supposed to be on watch,
but I abandoned everyone because…

01:08:58.416 --> 01:09:00.458
I am such an idiot!

01:09:00.541 --> 01:09:03.166
Thinking my parents
would actually come back for me.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.208
Ow!

01:09:05.208 --> 01:09:07.583
How is your tongue this--?

01:09:08.333 --> 01:09:11.041
You must've licked my toes
without me knowing

01:09:11.125 --> 01:09:13.791
'cause you're talking opposite right now.

01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:17.125
Get it together, kid.
Your family needs you.

01:09:17.208 --> 01:09:18.541
What family?

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:20.833
Isn't it obvious I don't have a fam--?

01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:23.833
Hold on a minute!

01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:26.541
If you don't have a family,
what do you call Bubsy?

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:29.583
Or the Muggle-Wumps? Or me?

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:33.000
What do you call that bald guy
with the high-waisted slacks

01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:35.000
who talks about his mom a lot?

01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:36.000
Hmm?

01:09:36.583 --> 01:09:38.458
I call him Mr. Napkin.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.708
You call him Mr. Napkin.

01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:45.416
The way I see it,
family isn't just who you're related to.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:49.541
It's who you care about,
and who cares about you,

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:53.916
and treats you with love
and kindness and empathy.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:56.458
You're right.

01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:58.791
The Twits hurt our family.

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.416
Now it's time to hurt them.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.291
Fun and excitement had a baby

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:08.166
And they called it Twitlandia

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.125
Welcome, Twitheads,

01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:13.041
to the re-grand opening of Twitlandia!

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:16.583
We are bigger and better than ever!

01:10:16.666 --> 01:10:18.875
Bigger and better

01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:22.416
Now you can spend the night,
and all your money,

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.458
at the Twitlandia Luxury Motel & Spa.

01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:29.333
And after you have
a slice of my famous bird pie,

01:10:29.416 --> 01:10:32.916
feel free to use our complimentary Napkin.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:33.916
Oh, jeez.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.250
Most importantly, thanks to you,

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:39.000
our Muggle-Wumps is back!

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:41.625
Fun and excitement had a baby

01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:44.416
They called it Twitlandia

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.666
Fun and excitement had a baby

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:51.333
And they called it Twitlandia

01:10:51.416 --> 01:10:52.750
Horvis Dungle!

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:57.791
Now, friends, Twitlandia is a fun park
that puts family values first,

01:10:57.875 --> 01:11:02.208
which is why we want to introduce you
to someone very special.

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:06.125
Our precious little son, Butt Cheek Twit.

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:09.583
Aw.

01:11:13.166 --> 01:11:15.708
Hello there. My name is Bubsy Twit--

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:17.166
Butt Cheek.

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.583
-My name is--
-Ah!

01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:20.166
Butt Cheek Twit,

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:23.541
and all I ever wanted
was to find a family.

01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:28.333
And now, I have one,
since Meemaw and Peepaw Twit adopted me

01:11:28.416 --> 01:11:31.000
and all of my brothers and sisters.

01:11:33.458 --> 01:11:35.000
That's right, folks.

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:39.083
We adapted a whole orphan-anage
full of youngsters.

01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:44.833
Just to bring you the Twit Family
Memorial Song and Dance Extravaganza!

01:11:44.916 --> 01:11:47.916
Hey! Hey!

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:57.500
Oh, Jim!

01:11:57.583 --> 01:12:00.000
All our dreams are coming true.

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:01.583
I know it, woman.

01:12:01.666 --> 01:12:04.625
Nothing could possibly
ruin this moment now.

01:12:05.958 --> 01:12:07.375
Ha!

01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:38.375
Ugh.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.875
Bubs!

01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:49.458
I'm so sorry I left you.

01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:51.583
Hey, get that girl.

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:55.041
So I can give her a tender embrace.

01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.833
Oh, what a wonderful child she is.

01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:58.833
Now, stop!

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:02.416
You're tickling my whiskers,
you little whisker-tickler.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.083
Oh!

01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:06.125
-Are you looking for this?
-Uh…

01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:08.625
Oh, bless her heart.

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:11.541
I think she wants to free
the Muggle-Wumps, Jim.

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:14.375
Oh? I would hope so.

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:16.375
It's the right thing to do.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:19.333
Go free, you precious creatures.

01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:20.541
Go free!

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.000
Thank you very much.

01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:25.541
It feels so good to be good,
don't it, James?

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:29.041
It do feel good, like a summer breeze.

01:13:29.125 --> 01:13:30.958
Ooh!

01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:39.333
Didn't they say we need
those Muggle-Wumps to save the town?

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.916
Come on, let's go. Everyone hurry.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:46.375
I kind of like having a beard.

01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:48.541
Get a hold of yourself, Harold!

01:13:49.791 --> 01:13:52.541
Stop! We're not leaving yet.

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:54.750
Beesha, what are you doing?

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.708
We're free.
There's nothing more for us to do here.

01:13:58.791 --> 01:14:00.208
You're wrong, Mrs. M.

01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:02.583
The effects of the toad's toes
will wear off,

01:14:02.666 --> 01:14:04.833
and the Twits will go back to being twits.

01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:07.125
You know better than anyone

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:09.791
that they will keep
coming after your family,

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:13.833
and hurting people, and hurting people,
and nothing will change.

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:17.166
We have to give them
a taste of their own medicine,

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:19.541
with a trick to end all tricks.

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:22.166
But I can't do it alone.

01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.541
So who's with me?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.791
Beg pardon, Mayor and Mayor Twit,

01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:36.541
but you told us
if we gave you $1,000 it'd save Triperot

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:38.708
and make us billionaires
when the park opened.

01:14:38.791 --> 01:14:42.541
Ah, the billionaire thing
and pretending we cared about Triperot.

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:44.291
Huh?

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.250
That was all a lie.

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:50.000
We spent all your money
on fake beards and fireworks.

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:51.125
For pity's sake.

01:14:51.208 --> 01:14:53.541
You people gave us hope.

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.958
And you gave us everything
we ever dreamed of.

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:59.791
But seeing as how we got it
by lying and cheating and hurting you,

01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:02.625
I… I don't like the woman I've become.

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:04.791
I'm ashamed of myself.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.208
I don't like the man I've become.

01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:09.208
I'm so sorry!

01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:13.750
Well, "sorry" just ain't gonna cut it.

01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:16.708
No way. I just put a down payment
on a new marimba.

01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:18.958
You lied to us.

01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:20.458
We trusted you!

01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:24.458
Oh, James, we have taken everything
from these poor people.

01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:26.541
There's only one thing to do.

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:29.750
Take everything from ourselves.

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:32.208
Friends, we've heard your concerns.

01:15:32.291 --> 01:15:34.833
We've got a solution.

01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:36.583
We're gonna blow up Twitlandia.

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:37.833
They're gonna what?!

01:15:37.916 --> 01:15:39.500
Blow up what?

01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:41.250
They're gonna blow it up?

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:44.875
-You mean right here where we're standing?
-These people are nuts.

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:59.666
You know, I'm starting to think
we should've listened to our daughter

01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:03.666
instead of the two strangers
we saw getting arrested on the news.

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:06.875
I'm also thinking that also as well.

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:20.875
Oh, I love fireworks, James.

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:35.500
What happened to our fun park?

01:16:35.583 --> 01:16:39.416
I have no idea,
but I'm certain it's your fault.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.666
Where on earth is our Muggle-Wumps?

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:46.875
There goes the lady one.

01:16:46.958 --> 01:16:47.958
Get her.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:56.500
The Twits are coming!
The Twits are coming!

01:16:56.583 --> 01:17:00.208
Go, go! More Hugtight glue on the floor.
Yeah, right there.

01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:01.666
Come on, now.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:05.333
All we wanna do is lock you in a cage
for the rest of your life,

01:17:05.416 --> 01:17:06.708
and maybe eat you.

01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:09.583
That little beast
is going inside our house.

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.291
Well, hurry up.

01:17:15.541 --> 01:17:16.750
Whoo!

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.083
Come on, get in!

01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:27.125
It went in there.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:32.333
What is this?

01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:46.458
What's happened? The floor is up there.

01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:48.500
We're upside down.

01:17:48.583 --> 01:17:50.375
We must be upside down.

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:53.541
I mean, we're standing on the ceiling,
looking at the floor.

01:17:57.583 --> 01:18:00.708
Oh, help! I'm beginning to feel giddy.

01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:02.708
I don't like this one little bit.

01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:06.666
The blood's going to my head.
I feel like I'm gonna die!

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:10.333
How do I… Oh, I've got it! I've got it!
We stand on our heads!

01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:11.625
What are you saying?

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:14.625
Stand on your head,
and then we'll be the right way up.

01:18:18.833 --> 01:18:20.291
-Whoa.
-That's better.

01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:23.333
Oh…

01:18:23.416 --> 01:18:24.916
I'm glued.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.250
It's Hugtight Sticky Glue.

01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:47.833
We've been tricked.

01:18:47.916 --> 01:18:50.625
You beastly little brats.

01:18:50.708 --> 01:18:52.708
You cut us down this instant, or--

01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:55.625
Or what? You'll cook us in a pie?

01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:58.541
No, you won't.

01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:02.000
You're never cooking another pie
because you're never getting free.

01:19:02.083 --> 01:19:05.541
There's enough cruelty and hatred
without the two of you running around.

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:10.916
Trust me, the world will be
a much better place without you in it.

01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:25.291
Oh! Cut it out.

01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:28.916
Please, somebody!
There's a grackle eating my face!

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.541
Help! I have to go potty.

01:19:31.625 --> 01:19:35.291
-Down with the Twits! Whoo-hoo!
-Help!

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.541
Take that, you dang rabbit.

01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:49.458
What do you really think
will happen to the Twits?

01:19:49.541 --> 01:19:51.541
Who gives a rip?

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.708
I know what'll happen.

01:19:57.041 --> 01:20:01.458
They're gonna get the Dreaded Shrinks.

01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:05.083
That's what happens
if you stand on your head long enough.

01:20:05.166 --> 01:20:08.541
First, their heads
will shrink into their necks.

01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:11.041
I'm shrinking!

01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:14.708
Somebody save me!
I'm getting the Dreaded Shrinks!

01:20:16.416 --> 01:20:19.625
Then their necks
will shrink into their bodies.

01:20:21.291 --> 01:20:25.208
Then their bodies
will shrink into their legs.

01:20:25.291 --> 01:20:28.625
Then their legs
will shrink into their feet,

01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:31.791
until there's nothing left
in this whole world

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:33.750
of Mr. and Mrs. Twit.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.041
Do you really think
that's gonna happen, Bubsy?

01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:45.625
I hope it does.

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:50.041
What do you think, Mrs. M?
Think they'll melt into a puddle of goo?

01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:53.416
Sorry, what's that?

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.041
Huh?

01:21:16.041 --> 01:21:18.583
I can't understand
the Muggle-Wumps, Beesha.

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:19.708
Can you?

01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:22.750
Um, Mrs. M?

01:21:23.666 --> 01:21:25.833
What's happening?

01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:29.666
Why can't I understand you?
Why can't I understand you?

01:21:31.833 --> 01:21:35.583
Please, no. No, I need you.
I-- I need you!

01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:48.083
Just as children
with a deep sense of empathy

01:21:48.166 --> 01:21:50.083
can understand animals,

01:21:50.166 --> 01:21:52.541
children without it can't.

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.666
It's as simple as that.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:05.208
You take all the good out of life.

01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:09.041
And you're the worst person I've ever met.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:16.500
Hating you is easy
'Cause you're horrible

01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:08.541
What on earth
are you gribbly little grubs doing here?

01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:15.166
We felt bad about the idea of you getting
the Dreaded Shrinks and, you know,

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.666
dying a horrible death.

01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:18.291
So we came back to save you.

01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:20.291
You did?

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.875
Sure did.

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:25.500
Hate is…

01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:27.791
so easy.

01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:30.833
You hate me, I hate you. Yay!

01:23:30.916 --> 01:23:32.958
Now we're enemies for life,

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:38.708
and I never have to think about the fact
that you're both human beings.

01:23:38.791 --> 01:23:42.541
Never have to wonder
how badly you must've suffered

01:23:42.625 --> 01:23:44.666
to become this mean.

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:48.541
Or imagine what my parents
went through when they left me.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.583
Hate's easy.

01:23:51.666 --> 01:23:53.958
But it'll eat you up inside

01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:57.916
until all that's left
is an angry little twit.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.041
I don't wanna live in a world
where hate wins.

01:24:01.125 --> 01:24:04.041
So yeah, I forgive you.

01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:05.541
You're free.

01:24:11.041 --> 01:24:12.541
Well, thank you.

01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.583
Yeah. Thanks.

01:24:18.666 --> 01:24:21.666
Now get over here
so I can cook you both in a pie.

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:24.708
Get back here,
you terrible little turnips!

01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.000
I'm hungry!

01:24:40.166 --> 01:24:42.333
-Oh no.
-I was afraid this might happen.

01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:43.750
It was worth a try!

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:48.958
Whoa!

01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:50.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:54.041
Good job, family.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.291
-Is that how the story ends?
-Not quite.

01:25:05.375 --> 01:25:07.625
Boing! Boing! Boing!

01:25:11.458 --> 01:25:13.625
So long, Mr. and Mrs. Twit.

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:16.583
We'll be taking back our orphanage now.

01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:23.250
-Well, that was unexpected.
-Yes.

01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:28.000
And after Mr. Napkin returned
the orphanage to its rightful location,

01:25:28.083 --> 01:25:31.000
the Muggle-Wumps
sold the formula for their tears

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:33.833
to a multinational corporation

01:25:34.333 --> 01:25:38.916
which used the tears to end
the world's dependence on fossil fuels.

01:25:39.458 --> 01:25:43.416
With the windfall of cash,
the Muggle-Wumps bought the orphanage,

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:47.250
adopted Beesha, Bubsy,
and all of the other orphans,

01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:50.958
and hired Mr. Napkin
as a part-time au pair.

01:25:51.458 --> 01:25:56.291
For her part, Beesha was credited
with saving Triperot from the Twits.

01:25:56.375 --> 01:26:00.958
And with her idea to refill Tripe Lake
with florbnorbles,

01:26:01.041 --> 01:26:05.666
Triperot became the fun capital
of the world once more.

01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:08.500
And they all lived happily ever after?

01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:10.583
Something like that.

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:12.500
Now go to bed.

01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:16.208
Oh, man. You've got to at least tell me
what happened to the Twits.

01:26:17.583 --> 01:26:18.875
All right.

01:26:18.958 --> 01:26:21.958
You might think that the Twits
would've learned a lesson,

01:26:22.041 --> 01:26:24.875
but it's not enough
to just learn something.

01:26:24.958 --> 01:26:31.166
You have to want to change,
and then make an effort to actually do so.

01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:35.500
Something the Twits
were entirely unwilling to do.

01:26:35.583 --> 01:26:38.541
This is the only way
to get rid of the side effects

01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:41.375
of the Dreaded Shrinks, my angel.

01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:43.500
Can you feel them stretching you?

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:46.291
I can. They're stretching me like mad.

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:48.583
Good. That means it's working.

01:26:48.666 --> 01:26:51.083
Are you sure my feet are tied properly?

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:55.041
If them strings around my ankles break,
it'll be goodbye for me.

01:26:55.125 --> 01:26:57.333
That's enough pull to take me to the moon.

01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:59.333
What a ghastly thought.

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:02.125
Wouldn't want anything
like that to happen, dear me.

01:27:03.125 --> 01:27:04.083
No.

01:27:07.291 --> 01:27:11.041
I'll get you for this,
you grizzly old grunion!

01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:14.333
Oi!

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:16.125
Whoa!

01:27:21.625 --> 01:27:24.333
Whoo-hoo!

01:27:24.416 --> 01:27:26.000
Whoo-hoo!

01:27:28.416 --> 01:27:30.583
No more beard, Mum!

01:27:30.666 --> 01:27:32.916
We're free! We're free from the beard!

01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:50.958
Tears are like magic

01:27:51.041 --> 01:27:56.000
And laughing is fun

01:27:56.083 --> 01:28:00.958
If you can have both of them

01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:05.166
Why just have one?

01:28:05.916 --> 01:28:10.250
Everything matters

01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:15.458
And all things belong

01:28:15.541 --> 01:28:20.083
Fear is the same place

01:28:20.166 --> 01:28:24.708
That courage comes from

01:28:30.041 --> 01:28:34.333
Family's not only

01:28:34.416 --> 01:28:39.666
Who you're related to

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:44.208
It's who you care for

01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:48.416
And who cares for you

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.291
It's easy to hate

01:28:53.375 --> 01:28:58.750
What you don't understand

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:03.000
If we don't agree

01:29:03.083 --> 01:29:08.500
Could you still take my hand?

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.750
Open the door

01:29:11.375 --> 01:29:13.041
Look what we've done

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:15.458
Open your heart

01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:18.166
How far we've come

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:22.333
Lessons in life

01:29:22.416 --> 01:29:27.833
They are learned in reverse

01:29:27.916 --> 01:29:31.916
My wisest friends

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.083
Talk completely backwards

01:29:37.666 --> 01:29:42.041
Nothing is pointless

01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:47.125
And nothing's too much

01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:51.250
You may feel small

01:29:51.333 --> 01:29:56.375
But you are big enough

01:29:57.208 --> 01:29:58.833
Open the door

01:29:59.541 --> 01:30:01.166
Look what we've done

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.333
Open your heart

01:30:04.416 --> 01:30:06.208
How far we've come

01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:08.500
Open the door

01:30:09.208 --> 01:30:10.916
Look what we've done

01:30:11.708 --> 01:30:13.416
Open your heart

01:30:14.083 --> 01:30:16.000
How far we've come

01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:38.125
Open the door

01:30:38.208 --> 01:30:40.625
Look what we've done

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:42.958
Open your heart

01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:45.375
How far we've come

01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:47.791
Open the door

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.791
Look what we've done

01:30:50.875 --> 01:30:52.666
Open your heart

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:54.375
How far we've come

01:31:16.541 --> 01:31:17.583
No!

01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:28.333
What?

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:30.375
Huh?

01:31:32.333 --> 01:31:35.125
Where on earth are we?

01:31:37.833 --> 01:31:39.375
It looks like…

01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:41.208
Loompaland.

01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:46.833
I don't like this. Not one little bit.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.208
-Mm.
-I knew it would end like this.

01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:57.291
-This is your fault!
-It's your fault, you dung beetle.

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:16.166
Every day I fall in love with you

01:32:16.875 --> 01:32:19.416
And then you hurt me

01:32:20.333 --> 01:32:22.958
Splitting my heart in two

01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:29.291
But then I fall once again

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.291
Well, I bought you a diamond ring

01:32:37.041 --> 01:32:39.750
Then later you pawned it

01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:43.166
Saying you'd lost it, babe

01:32:43.666 --> 01:32:49.375
Like a fool, I bought it again

01:32:53.208 --> 01:32:57.083
Please

01:32:57.166 --> 01:33:03.875
Please don't trick me again

01:33:03.958 --> 01:33:10.000
Please don't trick me again

01:33:10.083 --> 01:33:16.291
Please don't trick me again

01:33:19.625 --> 01:33:23.083
Well, I took you to the opera

01:33:24.125 --> 01:33:26.750
I thought it was fancy

01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:29.875
I went to the bathroom, babe

01:33:30.416 --> 01:33:34.541
And when I came out
You had left me alone

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:43.583
Well, we can't go on like this
My darling

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:47.083
My heart, it can't take it

01:33:47.666 --> 01:33:50.916
If you trick me again, my sweet

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.625
Your heart, I will break it

01:33:59.666 --> 01:34:04.333
So please

01:34:04.416 --> 01:34:11.125
Please don't trick me again

01:34:11.208 --> 01:34:17.208
Please don't trick me again

01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:23.583
Please don't trick me again

01:34:27.875 --> 01:34:29.083
Come on, darling

01:34:30.208 --> 01:34:35.916
-All I want is not to be lied to
-Please don't trick me again

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.541
I don't wanna trick you
You don't wanna trick me

01:34:39.625 --> 01:34:41.791
Can't we all just get along?

01:34:42.916 --> 01:34:44.125
I love you

01:34:45.208 --> 01:34:46.666
Do you love me?

01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:50.416
Why are we always
Fightin' all the time?

01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:52.583
I don't like it

01:34:58.708 --> 01:35:04.541
The world is red in tooth and claw

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:10.500
Jaws that bite and teeth that gnaw

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.416
Hear their screams

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.875
Their cries and roars

01:35:17.416 --> 01:35:23.000
Our lives are nasty, brutish and short

01:35:25.625 --> 01:35:29.625
But in dreams you are safe

01:35:29.708 --> 01:35:32.500
In dreams you are free

01:35:32.583 --> 01:35:35.333
In that beautiful place

01:35:35.416 --> 01:35:38.583
Close your eyes and you'll see

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:41.541
The flowers that smile

01:35:41.625 --> 01:35:46.625
The sun, it will shine

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:53.875
And nothing can hurt you now

01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:01.750
Only the lucky will survive

01:36:01.833 --> 01:36:07.625
Not everyone comes back alive

01:36:07.708 --> 01:36:10.541
The light goes out

01:36:10.625 --> 01:36:14.791
The shadows fall

01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:21.708
No one will hear you when you call

01:36:22.541 --> 01:36:26.500
But in dreams you are safe

01:36:26.583 --> 01:36:29.333
In dreams you are free

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:32.250
In that beautiful place

01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:35.416
Close your eyes and you'll see

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.291
The flowers that smile

01:36:38.375 --> 01:36:43.916
The sun, it will shine

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.250
And nothing can hurt you now

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.500
Hooray for ham

01:37:57.208 --> 01:38:01.000
La-la, la-la, it's suppertime
Hooray for ham, ha-ha, ha-ha

01:38:01.083 --> 01:38:02.583
Hooray for ham
