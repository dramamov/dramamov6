00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.920
(Why isn't Zhou here yet?)

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.180
Stay still.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.850
The doctor said you can't get
out of bed.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.460
Move it.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.120
Who told you to bring that here?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.350
Get that out of my sight.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.880
I'd rather hold it in than use this.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.950
Aren't you in a rush?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.990
Then hurry up.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.070
I won't look at you.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.350
I turn around.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.040
You don't feel awkward holding that?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.400
Move it.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.710
What are you doing? Move it.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm stepping out first.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.840
Tang.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.240
I'm heading out first.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.080
Tang.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.240
So,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680
how did you and Qin Zhuo
end up in the hospital last night?

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.400
Meng Tang.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.960
You know that photo is fake.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.080
I may not be that into you.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.150
But during our engagement,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.030
I never did anything to hurt you.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.080
So,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.030
you don't want to marry me?

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.590
I…

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.710
I just haven't figured things out.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.030
Alright.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.910
Let's call off the engagement.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.190
Be careful, Meng Tang!

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.990
Qin Zhuo, Qin Zhuo!

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.200
Well,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.310
if you're sure about ending it,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.070
what's your plan for the future?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.780
I'm thinking of quitting my job.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.430
Yeah.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.870
That's good.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.550
Tang,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.400
back then,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.880
Zhou Lu was tied down by his parents,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.150
and I was tied down by Zhou Yufeng.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.240
You're stuck on Qin Zhuo.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.560
Right now,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.080
Zhou Lu has already started

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.150
to fly toward his dreams.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.150
So,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.080
we should start living well too.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.750
Live for ourselves.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.600
Once I'm back,
I'll write my resignation.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.670
By then,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.510
I'll throw that resignation letter

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.780
right in Qin Zhuo's face.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.630
Alright, alright.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.760
I'm with you.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.000
Why didn't you show up earlier?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.950
Every time you're in trouble,
I'm the first there.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.240
Do you know how awkward I was just now?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.910
I don't eat.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.400
Fine.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.590
You

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.950
don't need to get so worked up.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.500
You just don't know
how to face Meng Tang.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.600
But that's not bad.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.410
Once you're discharged,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.220
you'll barely have a chance to see her.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.190
What do you mean by that?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.480
You need me to tell you?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.150
No matter how distant you were before,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500
she never gave up on you.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.440
But this time,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.160
she came to you on her own.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.270
Ask yourself why.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.120
You're saying,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.750
after breaking off the engagement,
she'll avoid me?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.990
But Jian Cheng and Zhou Yufeng tangled
for over 20 years,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.980
and even after the fallout,
she never avoided him.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.880
Meng Tang and I haven't been together
for long,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.550
but it's not enough for her to avoid me.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.550
I didn't bring up Zhou Yufeng
on purpose.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.720
Meng Tang isn't the same as Jian Cheng.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.600
When Meng Tang was little,
she was spoiled by her family

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.440
and had older brothers and sisters
to rely on.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.930
Her parents have always doted on her.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.680
The toughest obstacle in her life

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.670
is you.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.200
Think about it.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.680
If she can't get past this hurdle,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.990
will she come to see you?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.960
But Jian Cheng's situation is different.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.190
After her Grandma passed away,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.830
the whole family focused
on Jian Wenqian.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.560
Her life wasn't going well at all.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.950
Even Zhou Yufeng let her down.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.500
In an environment like that,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.390
she still managed to pull through.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.260
Even after what happened
in high school.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.480
Like you said, it's the environment.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.310
Meng Tang has her own way out,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.150
with her parents

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.440
and family.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.260
But what about Jian Cheng?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.160
Right now, she only has me.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.750
You keep going on and on.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.590
You just want to...

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.880
I'm saying all this because...

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.990
I want to brag about my wife.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.600
Come on.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.000
But Qin Zhuo,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.630
marriage is personal.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.040
I can't interfere in yours.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.480
But as your brother,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.850
I've got two things to say.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.910
First,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.950
you must handle the Mi Shan situation
properly.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.230
She knew well
that it was my gathering that day,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.460
yet she still dared to do this.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.000
Clearly, she knew you'd back her.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.630
I already warned her back then.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.440
You warned her, but she still dared.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.290
Second,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.630
if you really want to get married,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.660
Meng Tang is perfect for you.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.260
While she hasn't completely
given up yet,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.300
you still have a chance.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.470
Unless

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.360
you really don't want to get married.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.120
Don't mess with her in the future.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.270
Eat less, otherwise you'll have
to pee again later.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.210
Jian Cheng,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.070
you must bring Zhou Tingyan home
for dinner today.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.750
Didn't I tell you last time?

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.060
I don't get along with him.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.670
Don't play dumb with me.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.190
I've already heard.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.270
You got that Zhou Lu

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.560
into Qianyi Group as a manager.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.560
You still say Zhou Tingyan
doesn't favor you.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.630
(That chatty Jian Wenqian again.)

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.120
Dinner at home, right?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.920
Fine. What about the 9% shares?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.160
How about we settle that
when I get back?

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.600
Let me tell you something.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.160
This kind of thing has a process.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.680
It won't happen that quickly.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.190
Since I promised you,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.360
I won't go back on my word.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.160
You, you, you...

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.060
That's official business.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.440
Dinner is personal.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.720
Don't mix the two together.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.910
This weekend,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.430
bring my son-in-law over for dinner.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.280
Alright.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.680
Need a hand?

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.470
Yeah?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.480
Someone here

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.150

Sooner or later, I'll have to meet them.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.270
Actually, I have something

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.790
to discuss with Chairman Jian.

have a personal relationship?

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.720
It's just an old story

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.440
from the past.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.360
It doesn't matter.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.350
Alright.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.630

(One week later)

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.870
About calling off the engagement,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.150
you explain it to your family

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.690
and I'll explain it to mine.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.240
If they agree,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.150
how to end it

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.990
is up to you.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.030
As for work matters,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.550
I'll wrap things up as soon as I can.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.260
(Resignation Letter)

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.320
Qin Zhuo,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.480
from here on,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.080
I won't bother you again.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.980
Unless it's absolutely necessary,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.120
I'll try to stay out of your way.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.670
(Zhou was right about this.)

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.610
Hello.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.960
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.240
Your call will be sent to him
as a text.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.320
He really forgets me because of a woman.

(Resignation Letter)

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.140
(By Meng Tang)

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.030
This afternoon,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.600
Cheng is bringing her husband over
for dinner.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.960
Pay extra attention to the dishes.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.670
Make me a list to check later.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.680
Yes, sir.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.350
Oh, by the way,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.080
every time she comes home,
it's like a raid.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.080
Nothing is left behind.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.390
Hide all my treasures well.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.040
Alright, I'm on it.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.080
Are you sure she'll be back
this afternoon?

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.740
Last time you called her,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.910
she said she would come back,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.750
but she never did.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.200
She just posted something

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.740
on her Moments, didn't you see?

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.990
I'm so annoyed.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:00.850
Let me take a look.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.360
(Jian Cheng)
Heading home to kill mosquitoes.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.510
Poor Jian's getting tricked.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.910
Happiness level up by 10,000.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.390
This kid…

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.230
Well,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.770
ask Youhui to come back early
this afternoon.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.750
Sure.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.990
What about Wenqian?

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.370
Should we have Wenqian come too?

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.790
Of course.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.510
Didn't Cheng say

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.260
she has feelings for Zhou Tingyan?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.910
It's a perfect chance

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.790
to make her see the truth.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.080
Indeed.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.030
Wenqian isn't that young anymore.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.940
She should get married.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.750
Help find suitable candidates

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.360
and arrange a meeting if appropriate.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.150
Best to settle this within the year.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.480
Dad, you called me back in such a rush

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.030
just to tell me this nonsense?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.600
How could it be nonsense?

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.590
I'm telling you,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.440
remember

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.280
what I just told you.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.670
Zhou Tingyan rarely comes here.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.030
You're about the same age.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.440
It's right for you to talk about it.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.440
Do what I told you.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.480
Before the New Year,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.750
Zhou Tingyan

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.000
cut a few of Changsheng's projects.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.320
Back then,

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.350
even though I was upset,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.750
I couldn't really say anything.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.990
But now,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.320
he's the Jian Family's son-in-law.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.720
It's totally different.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.480
Dad,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.350
losing those projects is no big deal.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.540
The shares were uneven anyway.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.610
Even if we finished them,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.180
we wouldn't get much out of it.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.120
But now,

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200
I heard Qianyi Group

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.360
has an amusement park project.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.260
The party committee and the government
are paying close attention to this.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.300
That's a huge opportunity.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.960
If Zhou Tingyan brings us in,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.600
Changsheng's losses from last year
could be wiped clean.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.510
Dad, if you're busy,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.960
I'll head out first.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.350
I'm not busy.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.790
I'm just writing down

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.390
your sister's

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.510
sneaky tricks.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.930
Dad, what's the point
of writing all this?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.640
That girl is way too crafty.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.910
I list out

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.870
all the moves she has used,

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.720
one by one.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.150
While she's not back yet,

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.840
I study them well.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.000
I'll learn from them

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.030
and tackle them one by one.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.390
Cheng,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.890
you haven't been home for a while.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.720
I heard Qianyi Group's new project
is almost done.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.080
Congrats, Tingyan.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.850
I even coordinated with you
on it before.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.730
Pan Yu has always handled projects
between the two groups.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.490
I'm not the one handling it.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.360
Besides, lately the two sides

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.630
don't seem to work together.
