[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 34]

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.020
Come in.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.260
Who are you?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.260
Mr. Cao,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.460
it's me.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.380
Yangshan.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.410
Mr. Cao.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.100
Deputy Chief Luo.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.540
I come to assume the post
as the Chief of the Cipher Division.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.260
Why is Gu Yangshan back?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.940
What about the former Division Chief Wu?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.500
Division Chief Wu has defected,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.540
so Chief Cao is very anxious

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.780
to replace all ciphers.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.500
He's grasping at straws!

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.260
Contact all field agents immediately

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.540
and tell them face to face

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.150
the original frequency band,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.100
ciphers,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.820
and all previous schedules are scrapped.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.130
We'll set up a brand-new contact plan.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.980
I'll never use a set of cipher

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.540
that's been handled
by the Communist Party.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.260
But our operatives

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.780
are scattered all over the city.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.060
Meeting each one face-to-face

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.180
will take two or three days.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.540
Then get moving!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.660
Yes, sir.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.500
Leader Xian isn't here.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.780
Please go in and wait a moment.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.940
Instructor Ding.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.870
What are you sniffing around for?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.020
The Joseph Lee cipher

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.360
is far more intricate

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.840
than a typical monoalphabetic cipher.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.340
If it weren't
for the most critical secrets,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.730
they certainly wouldn't attempt

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.180
such a troublesome encryption method.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.700
So cracking it

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.340
has become our top priority.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.380
The central directive states

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.590
Shanghai, as the largest industrial
and commercial city in the Far East,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.780
must be returned intact to the people

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.780
as a world-renowned city.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.780
Last time I met Gu Yangshan.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.460
He told me

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.830
he was still studying
the Joseph Lee cipher.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.460
Now this cipher system

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.340
has been put into use so quickly.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.700
It must be the result of his research.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.660
The Joseph Lee cipher,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.100
you know,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.980
is impossible to crack in a short time.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.100
So the only option now

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.140
is to try to contact Gu Yangshan.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.330
He's been out of touch with us
for four years.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.460
All these years

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.140
he has been stuck in Nanjing,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.770
conducting research behind closed doors.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.860
How will you get in touch?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.850
However, I do not believe

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.140
that without Gu Yangshan's guidance,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.100
cipher officers
from the KMT Secrets Bureau

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.100
could crack Joseph Lee cipher.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.100
He must be back.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.120
Division Chief Gu,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.220
Deputy Chief Luo said,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.220
in these unusual times,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.750
if you can't find
a suitable housekeeper,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.140
the clothes at the Gu Residence

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.100
will have to be sent

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.780
to an outside laundry shop instead.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.100
Hope you can understand.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.790
Sorry for that.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.140
Thank you.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.580
Take care.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.080
[Noodle]

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.580
Sir,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.340
one bowl of Plain Noodles, please.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.780
Okay, have a seat.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.780
Let me pour you some tea.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.420
Here's your tea.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.170
Sorry, my bad.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.440
There's a tailor shop across the street.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.580
I know the owner pretty well.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.130
How about I take you to change clothes?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.490
Sounds good.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.780
Is the opening line still going

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.730
to be "long time no see" this time?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.980
This time it's...

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.580
Get lost.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.100
Why are you being rude?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.700
We agreed back then

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.820
we'd meet in Yan'an.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.820
But when everyone moved to Xibaipo,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.460
you still didn't show up.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.440
Don't you deserve to be scolded?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.010
Meng Jie...

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.580
How is she?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.460
She's doing great.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.340
By the time she got to Yan'an,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.820
she was already a chief physician.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.700
Later, she moved to Peiping
with the Central Committee,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.440
looking forward every day to returning

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.220
to Shanghai to find you
after the liberation.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.580
Biyun said

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.580
that the letters from Miss Meng to her

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.580
were even more frequent than mine.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720
Every month she'd ask

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.090
how things were going in Shanghai,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.460
and if there was any news from you.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.100
If you don't bring her to Shanghai soon,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.100
I'm afraid my wife will be
driven crazy by her.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.700
Once peace comes,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.820
I can go to Peiping instead.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.340
Then we'll find a courtyard,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.460
and our families can live together
there.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.130
Still playing the trick of pouring water
to change clothes?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.340
That was a trick I played

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.580
back at Yuyin Pavilion.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.820
Looks like over the years,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.580
he hasn't made much progress.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.820
Should we arrest the noodle stall owner

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.060
and the tailor shop owner

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.460
for questioning?

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.460
Are we tipping them off too soon?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.940
If so,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.280
no one will walk into the trap I set.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.700
When I first arrived in Nanjing,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.820
Comrade Xiao reached out to me.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.480
He arranged for me to join the Party.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.390
But not long after,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.580
I lost contact with the organization.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.370
Here.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.580
I've been trying to reach you
for four years.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.760
But I was kept under close watch
in Nanjing,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.340
completely out of options.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.220
It was not until Cao Yuanzhong

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.000
wanted to use the Joseph Lee cipher

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.040
that I found the opportunity
to return to Shanghai.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.680
I've never wanted to side
with the wrong people.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.100
So all these years,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.080
I've only been focusing on one thing.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.530
Studying the Joseph Lee cipher.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.940
Well?

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.700
Can I help you this time?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.820
Help a lot.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.340
After liberation,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.100
I will apply to the higher authorities

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.690
to set up a special class for you,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.460
so that you can teach everyone

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.600
the principles of this cipher system
in full.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.940
How did you know

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.420
that I want to teach
after achieving peace?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.220
Because I'm already teaching now.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.580
Whenever my students stump me,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.820
I always think to myself,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.580
if only Gu Yangshan were here.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.220
Because

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.980
he really loves doing this.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.580
Alright, alright.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.770
Let's get serious.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.940
Do you know where this cipher is used?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.580
I only know this cipher

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.890
is used in a secret operation
by Luo Han.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.980
But he's only using people
from outside the unit.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.220
As for the mission details,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.220
only Cao Yuanzhong and he know.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.340
I haven't found out anything else yet.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.490
That's fine.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.940
We've been tracking his radio
for a long time.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.000
Biyun

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.030
has his transmission logs
from the past two months.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.940
With this info,

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.980
we'll soon know exactly what he's up to.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.300
In that call just now,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.940
Commander Tang's exact words were,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.610
to make Shanghai

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.820
into Verdun in the First World War,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.020
Stalingrad in the Second World War.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.740
If we can't hold Shanghai,

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.460
we'll have to clear it out,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.460
smash it,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.170
blow it up...

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.720
Scorched earth.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.620
Explosives.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.340
Shanghai.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.340
Our Scorched Earth Plan

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.740
is to carry out Commander Tang's orders.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.220
This is the initial setup for the plan.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.460
Each of you is an outstanding talent

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.020
personally selected by Director Mao.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.620
At Shanghai's power plant...

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.980
Power plant...

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.570
the docks, train stations and so on,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.860
I've already arranged
the explosion plans.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.340
TNT.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.140
The first batch of explosives
weighs 100,000 jin,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.460
with TNT making up one-fifth of that.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.260
Explosion.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.460
I'm going to bomb Shanghai to pieces.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.170
He's planning to bomb Shanghai.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.220
That Luo Han

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.740
is completely out of his mind.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.290
Blow it up the moment we enter.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.500
Since he dared to say that,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.930
that means everything's already set up.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.860
It means

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.340
half of Shanghai's public facilities

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.690
are tied to a powder keg by this maniac.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.320
Now we simply don't have time

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.990
to track down those explosives
one by one.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.460
Besides, Luo Han's using

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.340
only the agents Mao Renfeng

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.100
placed personally in deep cover,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.340
all seasoned old hands.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.430
They're hard to track down.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.980
We have no time left.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.020
The first phase of the Wusong Campaign

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.100
is almost over.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.340
The final assault

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.050
is at the breaking point.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.170
We don't know how many agents they have.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.930
Even if we get the full list,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.290
there's no way in such a short time

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.170
to track each of them down

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.130
and bring them in.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.810
I have an idea.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.690
Back when I was studying in Yan'an,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.890
our instructor told us a story.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.330
After the Four Crossings
of the Chishui River,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.890
the central leadership
approved Zeng Xisheng's proposal

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.990
to impersonate Chiang Kai-shek
over the radio,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.140
that bought time to cross the Wu River

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.740
and helped the Red Army
shake off the KMT Army's pursuit.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.930
You mean

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.260
we could use Joseph Lee cipher
to pose as Luo Han

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.600
and send messages to his people?

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.220
Liu.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.260
Come here. Come on.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.650
Listen.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.500
At this time, on this frequency,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.410
why would someone be sending telegrams?

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.520
This is the new radio

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.670
that Deputy Chief Luo just applied for
a few days ago.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.380
He asked us not
to run any detection on it.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.570
A new radio?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.860
Didn't we already give him

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.500
a special radio?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.260
I have no idea.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.500
He applied for a new one
the day you arrived.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.200
And he said he'd send messages himself,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.600
and doesn't need us to get involved.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.570
Deputy Chief Luo is so ignorant
of the rules now.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.520
If he doesn't want us to get involved,

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.660
then what cipher is he using?

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.260
Could he be using an official radio

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.740
with his own private cipher?

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.620
Don't get him wrong.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.380
Deputy Chief Luo is not
that kind of person.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.260
The ciphers he uses are all filed

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.160
with the Confidential Office,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.500
and follow every proper procedure.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.140
Alright.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.860
I don't mean that.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.760
I don't get him wrong.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.500
Relax.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.740
Deputy Chief Luo and I have been friends

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.140
for over a decade.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.620
Alright.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.860
Go get some sleep.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.500
Yes, sir.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.380
Hello?

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.380
Get me the Communications Officer.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.890
Don't move.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.500
Division Chief Gu,
what are you doing here?

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.740
I heard that Deputy Chief Luo

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.500
applied for a new radio,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.020
but the corresponding codebook

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.020
was not archived at our Cipher Division.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.150
Instead, a copy was kept
in the Confidential Office.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:16.740
Is that true?

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.020
Yes.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.290
It's true.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.700
Alright.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.020
He's really getting out of line.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.020
He ignored the bureau's
radio and cipher,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.020
and actually used
his own private cipher instead.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.790
Let me tell you something.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.810
This is a serious breach of discipline.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.050
I suspect he's secretly in contact
with the enemy.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.050
Tell me where the codebook is.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.020
Hand it over.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.660
I need to take it back
to the Cipher Division for backup.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.530
Division Chief Gu,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.770
my job is to keep the codebook safe

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.180
and then send it to China Taiwan
for record-keeping.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.690
Everything else is none of my concern.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.290
But you

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.500
call me out in the middle of the night
for classified info,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.500
that's probably a serious breach
of disciplines,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.460
right?

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.370
How about this?

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:09.660
Tomorrow,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.020
we'll go to the Chief together
to report it.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.290
What do you think?

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.770
Alright.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.990
At least you still know the rules.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.460
In that case,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.500
I'll wait for you

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.500
at the door of the Chief's office

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.890
tomorrow morning.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.020
Head back.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.260
Get rest early.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.440
I'm going, Division Chief Gu.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:33.850
Thanks.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.020
Thanks.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:28.740
Hello?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.740
Is this Xikang Clinic?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.740
The prescription you gave me last time,

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:37.980
I've finished it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.770
But my heart

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.740
still feels uneasy.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.570
How about I go to see you

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.090
tomorrow morning,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.370
and you examine me?

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.050
Something happened.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.700
Luo Han uses a new frequency
and ciphers.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.660
No way.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.700
On the original frequency,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.890
he's still sending messages
with the Joseph Lee cipher.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.740
His sending style is very distinctive,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.660
long high notes and short low notes.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.290
I couldn't mishear it.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.700
A new radio.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.740
Our comrades in Shanghai
have already noticed it.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.330
The new radio has sent several messages.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.550
We've kept records of them all.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.700
Now, this Joseph Lee cipher

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.020
is probably left on purpose

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.100
by Luo Han to throw us off.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.420
Gu Yangshan said

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.740
he's got the codebook
for Luo Han's new radio.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.740
I'll go find him right now.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.020
That fast?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.980
You know his abilities well.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:44.900
Every morning at six,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.810
Luo Han sends messages
using the Joseph Lee cipher.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.220
You should stay here

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.740
and observe his transmissions.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.020
I can go alone.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.460
Once I get the new codebook,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.050
we'll stick to the original plan.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.290
No mistakes allowed.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.740
Alright, we'll do it your way.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:49.980
Why?

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.300
Why didn't Luo Han send anything today?

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.570
Unless…

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.660
Dr. Li,

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.770
the prescription you gave me last time

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.330
didn't work after I finished taking it.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.900
Go check it.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.290
Hurry up! Search.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.180
Report.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.660
He is gone.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.160
Only this piece of clothing is left.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.290
Over there is an abandoned
chemical plant.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.980
Get in the car!

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.700
Comrade Biyun.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.660
What's wrong?

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.980
Someone was tailing me just now.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.500
But I set up a diversion.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.290
Quick, take a look.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.500
This is the codebook.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.260
Check it.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.530
Well?

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.770
It doesn't match the cipher
we intercepted.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.980
It's fake.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.500
It's fake?

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.020
How could it be possible?

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.770
That jerk!

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.530
He put a fake one
in the Confidential Office

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.810
just to lure me out.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.120
He is no longer acting
for official business.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.390
He's taking personal revenge.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.360
Let's do this way.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.500
Comrade Biyun,

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.440
I'll find another way
to get the real codebook.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.290
We need to leave now.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.770
Let's go.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.530
They're here.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.740
Secretary Liu,

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.020
have someone to follow you.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.120
Find a high vantage point.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.020
Once they step out,
take photos as evidence.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:13.530
You.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.290
Call Chief Cao

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.740
and tell him

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.980
the communist and the mole
have been found.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.280
Ask Chief Cao to bring his team here.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:21.570
Got it.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:39.980
Yangshan.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:40.770
Go up.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:08.900
Yangshan.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.770
This way.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.290
Let's go.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.740
Hurry.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.570
We can't leave together.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.390
What are you saying?

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.430
Luo Han just suspects you.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.960
As long as he doesn't catch us meeting,

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.740
you're not exposed.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.810
Go down from here.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.180
Head back to Shanghai Bureau

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.500
to find the real codebook.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.290
I'll take the stairs.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.810
No way.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.740
You can't take the stairs.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.150
He has already lost control.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.260
He doesn't care if we're actually
meeting or not.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.260
If he finds us here,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.290
none of us will get out.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.290
Don't you get it yet?

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.740
Stay undercover,

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.220
disrupt the Scorched Earth Plan,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.560
and peacefully liberate Shanghai.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.570
That's your real mission.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.020
I'll finish my mission,

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.700
but first,

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.460
I need to get you out safe.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.290
For duty's sake, I can't
leave you here alone,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.320
and personally, I can't let anything
happen to you.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.530
Or Ding Yi will not forgive me.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.090
He won't!

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.810
Understand?

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.770
He won't.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.500
He is a mature Communist Party member.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.330
He knows the mission's importance.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.330
Shanghai is about to be liberated.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.530
A city of six million people

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.100
can't be ruined by a bunch of lunatics.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.260
Six million lives.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.020
I understand what you're saying.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.420
I will find the real codebook.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.150
But the condition

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.020
is not at the cost of anyone's life.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.120
Think about Comrade Bai Ye.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.180
Think about your Uncle Gu.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.630
How did they complete their missions?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.380
Have you forgotten?

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.790
I haven't.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.700
I haven't.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.700
It's because I still remember them,

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.180
that's why I'm determined

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.610
to join the Communist Party.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.940
I'm now
a Communist Party member too.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.460
I've read the Admission Oath aloud.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.290
I won't abandon my comrades.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.700
Comrade Gu Yangshan,

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.370
since you've taken the oath,

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.460
you need to follow the Party's rules.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.610
I'm your superior,

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.850
so follow my orders.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.460
Hand me the gun.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.940
There's no time left.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.370
Follow the order.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:30.700
I firmly...

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.700
Firmly obey orders.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.180
We can split up.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.180
But remember,

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.460
stay alive.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.890
Take care.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.460
Take care.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:57.980
Take care.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.570
Xian Biyun,

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.330
just surrender.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.130
There's no way out.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.300
If you surrender now,

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.850
I'll guarantee you'll live.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.650
No one else is going to die today.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.090
I'm not like you.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:46.650
I'm not afraid of dying.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.410
If I were afraid of dying,

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.820
I would've run away long ago!

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.040
Would I still be standing here?

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.450
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.810
Superstar,

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.370
you've got nowhere left to run, right?

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.500
That Canadian gun in your hand

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.370
only holds 13 bullets.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.130
Now you're down to just one.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.260
And you don't have another magazine.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:52.810
Am I right?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.540
Xian Biyun,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.300
aren't you good at counting?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.940
Then count carefully.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.410
I just switched to a new magazine.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.610
Now I've got 13 bullets ready.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.940
You're down to your last bullet.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.610
If we have to go head-to-head,

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.080
who do you think has the better odds?

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.570
Me.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.020
Luo Han!

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.980
Luo Han, I'm right here!

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.020
Stop trying to act tough.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.300
You're holding Gu Yangshan's gun, right?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:43.890
Look.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.650
See that?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.850
Do you really think by doing this,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.890
you can keep Gu Yangshan safe?

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.020
Let me tell you this,

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.460
I marked the bullets issued to him

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.020
a long time ago.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.060
Even if you kill me,

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.460
Gu Yangshan won't get away clean.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.020
Can your belief save you now,
Xian Biyun?

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.420
Stand up.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.790
Stand up and I won't pull the trigger.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.170
I marked the bullets issued to him

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.730
a long time ago.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.770
Even if you kill me,

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.170
Gu Yangshan won't get away clean.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.500
Luo Han!

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.650
Put the gun down.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.820
I can keep you alive.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.130
Drop it.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.690
I've figured it out.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.130
We both

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.900
will die under Gu Yangshan's gun.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.720
What are you doing, Xian Biyun?

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.540
You'll never

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.570
get the real codebook.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:17.690
Biyun.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.460
Comrade Biyun,

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.770
about what I mentioned
in my letter before,

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.130
what's your take?

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.290
Didn't I write you a letter

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.820
saying that I want us

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.540
to return to the troupe

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.290
to hold our wedding later?

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.340
I've already asked Mr. Wu
to get in touch

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.290
with Zhao Fu,

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.500
Aunt Sufen,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.500
Long Er and the others.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.540
Are you okay with that?

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.980
That letter?

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:53.340
I got it.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.640
I tried a few times to reply,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.340
but never knew how to start.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.650
Kept overthinking it
until I missed the chance.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.020
You...

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.020
Don't want it?

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.130
No, I was just so happy

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:20.860
that I didn't know what to write.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.290
We haven't seen them in years.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.460
I really miss them.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.590
I heard Long Er has his own
theatre troupe now.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.860
We should call him Leader Long.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.500
And Zhao Fu is writing a serial novel,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.190
single-handedly supporting
two newspapers.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.020
His article

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.860
can finally not be changed
by even a single word now.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.290
Aunt Sufen and Zhao Fu are together.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.210
I wonder now

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:02.060
if her leg still hurt when it rains.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.820
Nizi must be in middle school by now.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.210
And Douzi has grown up too.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.340
Do you think

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.540
they still remember me?

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.340
Of course they do.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.540
Xian Biyun,

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.290
a woman who seems to step
out of a magazine.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.500
One glance at her,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.980
and you'll never forget
for the rest of your life.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.940
Wait for me.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.160
I'll wait for you.
