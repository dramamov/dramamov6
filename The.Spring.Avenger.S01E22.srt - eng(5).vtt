WEBVTT

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.120
Qiushan.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.720
Qiushan.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.840
Qiushan.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.039
Qiushan.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.360
Qiushan.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.400
Qiushan.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.600
Qiushan.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.680
Qiushan.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.600
Are you okay?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.120
I think my bone is broken.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.240
Let's go.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.020
We need to get to the hospital.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.880
Come on.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.840
Let's go.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.880
Move.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.080
Hurry.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.120
I'll carry you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.640
Let's go.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.400
That's Mu Qiushan.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.160
Yes.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.360
How did he get injured?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.280
I don't know.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.480
Probably made an operational error.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480
But it's perfect timing.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.360
If he dies,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.320
our problem will be solved.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.760
You sent someone to do it.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.880
Why did you take matters into your own hands?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.840
Without the patent,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.300
what am I supposed to tell the shareholders?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.440
Jiang Chunyu.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.960
How is Qiushan?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.240
Is his life in danger?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.520
Qiushan ended up like this

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.320
because of you and Gu Xiaomeng.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.130
How dare you come here with your crocodile tears.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.120
Get out.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.040
Why should I leave?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.840
You're the homewrecker who destroyed our relationship.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.920
But now,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.880
Qiushan has finally seen

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.320
who you really are.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.680
He's ready to reconcile with me.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.800
If you two want to argue, do it outside.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.920
This is the emergency room.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.120
Don't interfere with our patient care.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.680
If you've got the guts, come with me.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.120
Let's talk in private.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.560
Stop looking.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.440
It's just you and me here now.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.520
Jiang Chunyu.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.360
Do you know what Mu Qiushan

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.320
was doing

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.480
before the car accident?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.320
He was in bed

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.440
with me.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.040
Let me go!

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120
Let me go!

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.320
Gu Nian.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.360
You can fight me however you want.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.090
But if you dare mess with Mu Qiushan again,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.010
I'll make sure you die without a burial place.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.320
Jiang Chunyu.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.840
Weren't you being so arrogant?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.240
Go ahead and act tough now.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.640
I dare you.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.760
What took you so long?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.720
Sorry, Nian.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.780
There was traffic.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.700
I thought Jiang Chunyu was pretty tough,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.680
but she still ended up defeated by our Nian.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.600
Anyone who fights against me

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.040
has only one path - death.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.320
Nian.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.970
She won't die, will she?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.520
Don't worry.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.840
It's not time yet.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.159
The medicine seller said

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.720
this drug

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.880
just works slowly.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.640
Its only advantage

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.440
is that all modern equipment

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.320
can't detect it.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.840
She can only slowly

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.520
wait for death.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.120
These days,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.250
where can you even find such drugs?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.240
Nian,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.280
you weren't scammed, were you?

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.159
How about

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.560
you try it?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.320
I'm sorry, Nian.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.320
Otherwise

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240
I'll

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.760
slash Jiang Chunyu's face

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.160
to avenge you.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.740
Be careful with it.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.240
Don't break it.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.600
Don't move.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.160
Weren't you poisoned?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.130
Please read more books when you have time.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.000
Don't you know there are many ways

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.520
to dilute poison?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.840
Plus with this,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.200
the toxins in my body

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.000
were quickly cleared out.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.400
Is Mu Qiushan's family here?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.480
Doctor.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.800
How is he?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.640
Is it serious?

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.040
The fracture isn't too bad,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.440
but he injured his spinal cord.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.600
The worst outcome

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.040
is permanent paralysis.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.420
How could this happen?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.680
Doctor.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.960
Please, I beg you to save him.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.040
We'll do our best.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.920
But you must pay attention to

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.280
the patient's mental state.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.040
Most people find this difficult to accept.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.120
As family members,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.560
you must maintain a positive attitude

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.640
and provide encouragement.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.440
Okay.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.160
Sis.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.520
Since things have come to this point,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.680
let's just cancel

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.000
this marriage.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.760
As for the patent issue,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.280
I'll find another solution for you.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.520
I want to continue.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.560
Are you crazy, sis?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.720
He's already become a cripple.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.400
You...

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.360
Do you love him that much?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.080
This has nothing to do with love.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.800
The Gu Group is my last card.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.720
If I lose it,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.560
I'll truly have nothing left.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.440
I'm so tired.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.160
I'm so exhausted.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.320
Sis.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.000
You still have me.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.440
We've known each other for 20 years.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.450
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.760
I'll give you anything you desire.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.600
I'll give it to you.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.160
Gu Xiaomeng.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.040
What I want,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.000
you can never give me.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.160
I told you long ago,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.480
don't have any hopes for her.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.600
It's not too late to back out now.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.880
Haven't I told you before

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.900
don't let me hear this kind of talk again.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.960
Yes.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.920
In your heart,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.700
I'll never be worthy of comparison with Gu Nian.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.720
But do you know what?

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.960
In this world,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.840
only I,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.960
only I, Fang Yue, truly care about you.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.120
I don't want to see you

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.450
walking step by step toward destruction.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.360
I will handle everything.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.380
I don't need your help.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
Chunyu.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.080
Do you have something on your mind?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.040
Auntie,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.200
how did you know?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.440
Shuyun once told me

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.800
that you

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800
seem sweet and cheerful,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.120
but you actually keep a lot to yourself.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.960
When something serious happens,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.520
you tend to bottle it up.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.040
All these years...

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.600
I've long considered you

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.000
as my own daughter.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.730
If something's troubling you,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.560
would you tell me about it?

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.080
Auntie...

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.360
Does everyone who gets involved with me

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.740
end up becoming unfortunate?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.140
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.440
Don't let yourself be brainwashed

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.040
by such ridiculous ideas.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.400
Everyone's fate

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.440
is their own responsibility.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.880
As long as you don't harm others,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.680
you can have a clear conscience.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
As long as I have a clear conscience.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.780
By the way, Auntie.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.500
Mu Qiushan and I are together now.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.210
Next time I'll bring him to meet you

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.040
as my future partner.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.400
Good.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.770
Make sure you bring him.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.720
Thank you, Auntie.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.280
Look at you,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.840
being so formal with me.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.640
You're awake.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.720
Chunyu.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.800
My legs.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.040
It's okay.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.810
I know many specialists in this field.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.920
If this hospital can't help you,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.960
we'll try other hospitals.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.930
You'll definitely get better.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.800
Qiushan.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.720
Even if your legs never heal,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.120
I still want to marry you.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.800
Let's get married.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.920
I'm useless now.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.200
Love doesn't matter anymore.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.200
You should find someone more suitable.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.160
Qiushan.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.880
Jiang Chunyu.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.520
I don't understand

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.040
what you're really thinking.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.680
This relationship exhausts me.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.840
Since my body is ruined now,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.800
let's end this completely.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.080
Are you deaf?

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.360
Can't you hear someone asking you to leave?

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.720
If you shamelessly refuse to leave,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.440
I'll call security.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.640
Mu Qiushan.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.360
Don't regret this.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.760
Mu Qiushan has changed too quickly.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.440
Something feels

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.600
off about him.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.400
It seems

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.240
the toxins have been almost completely eliminated.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.500
It won't interfere with my date tonight.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.800
Did you and Mu Qiushan

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.970
really break up?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.520
Don't worry about that.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.400
How are the arrangements for what comes next?

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.520
It's time to close the net.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960
Then Gu Xiaomeng,

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.770
he can't escape either, right?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.370
Do you want to watch him die,

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.680
or see him go to prison?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.480
Take your pick.
