Zhou Tingyan, what took you so long?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.200
Are you hurt?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.680
My hand hurts.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.950
Sorry, this is all my fault.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.950
This won't happen again.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.880
By the way,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.230
this is my husband.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.070
Zhou Tingyan.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200
And this is Su Yun.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.580
(Why haven't they come out
after such a long time?)

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.200
(All three of them get together.)

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.510
(Hope they don't start a fight.)

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.040
Hi,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.150
I'm Su Yun.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.590
Jian Cheng, you guys head back first.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.070
I need some rest too.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.790
It's been a tiring day.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.790
Alright.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.230
Then get some good rest.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.520
OK.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.760
Let's go.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.550
Wait a sec.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.570
She

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.000
just spent half an hour scolding me.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.680
Right in my face.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.960
Let's go.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.190
Jian Cheng

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.840
is no ordinary person.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.150
If I'd known earlier,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.470
I should have taken her
to a more remote place

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.840
and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.560
had her dealt with right away.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.910
What are you doing?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.430
I just sensed something was off.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.800
Even though those men were rough
with me,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.200
at least they didn't go all the way.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.120
But with Jian Cheng,
they went full force.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.360
So are they really the ones

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.800
you sent?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.980
Sure.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.960
I did it for you.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.310
For me?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.160
You sent several grown men

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.800
to ruin a young woman's dignity.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.780
Do you even have a heart?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.310
You ran into her today.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.840
Wasn't that part of your plan?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.960
What right do you have to judge me?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.190
If I want Zhou Tingyan back,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.280
I've got a better way.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.120
What way?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.990
When you dug into Jian Cheng earlier,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.080
you told me about her and Zhou Yufeng.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.190
So if we want Jian Cheng away
from Zhou Tingyan,

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.310
the best method is

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.840
to make her feel

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.840
that she turns into Jiang Yawei

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.890
in my and Zhou Tingyan's story.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.400
Go wait for me in the car.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.470
Yeah.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.910
Qin Zhuo.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.520
Yeah?

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.360
About what happened today,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.200
can we keep it between us?

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.030
What's wrong?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.520
If Tang finds out

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.470
that I got harassed
and almost kidnapped again,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.710
she'll be really worried.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.750
Alright.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.710
I can keep it a secret.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.270
Alright.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.240
I'm going.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.360
Mr. Zhou,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.110
they insisted

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.160
that they were just drunk,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.120
simply acting on lust.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.600
Quite stubborn.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.080
But

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.720
your guess

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.120
is probably right.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.720
Are those people you found today

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.870
reliable?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.910
No worries.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.150
Hello? Jian Cheng.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.070
It's me.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.910
Su Yun.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.120
I want you

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.000
to do me a favor.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.670
Sure.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.950
These days, help me

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.040
find a few trustworthy guys
to keep a close eye.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.880
Alright.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.760
And then?

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.430
Zhang Zhen's main base
isn't in Jiangyu.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.920
She's only here for two or three days
this time.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.680
Yet she's already found
such loyal people.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.140
Don't you think that's odd?

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.420
She's got someone

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.680
backing her in Jiangyu?

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.630
Who dare mess with Jian Cheng here?

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.920
From what I know,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.560
she's got an acquaintance in Jiangyu.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.960
Who?

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.120
Jian Wenqian.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.870
You're trying to use these people
as a lead,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.040
to dig up Jian Wenqian's background.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.310
(I should have told Jian Cheng earlier)

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.610
(about Su Yun.)

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.430
Zhou Tingyan.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.150
Zhou Tingyan.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.110
Yeah?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.310
I didn't pick up your calls today.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.830
Are you upset with me?

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.230
Jian Cheng,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.560
I'll ask Pan Yu to get you a driver.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.440
Sounds good.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.350
Jian Cheng,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.680
there's something

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.400
I want to tell you.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.270
Go ahead.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.240
I think between us,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.430
there shouldn't be secrets.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.240
As for what happened today...

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.960
Yeah.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.240
The more we care,
the more we need to be honest.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.190
I need to tell Tang
about what happened today.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.630
Meng Tang still comes first.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.060
(Mi Shan)

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.970
(I'd better explain it.)

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.510
If Tang finds out

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.310
I was harassed and almost kidnapped,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.190
she'll be really worried.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.660
(Jian Cheng didn't ask me to tell her
about what happened tonight.)

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.870
(Forget it.)

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.950
Hello. The person you called is busy.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.870

Hello. The person you called is busy.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.120
Hello. The person you called is busy.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.630
Your call info will be sent
as a text message. Goodbye.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.190
(Who's she talking to this late
at night?)

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.720
(Could it be that pretty peacock?)

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.240
By the way,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.510
Su Yun asked you to help her
handle Director Mei?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.870
Will you ask Zhou Tingyan
to step in and help?

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.630
No way.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.690
To handle this,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.890
I have to ask someone for help.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.390
Zhou Tingyan

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.660
can only ask for help for me,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.870
not for any other woman.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.030
I'm possessive,

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.320
jealous, and protective.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.270
But…

oh, Director Mei,

still not reconciled?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.220
I'm hanging up.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.270
I'll think it over alone.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.230
Yeah.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.840
Hello?

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.200
Auntie,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.150
Su Yun got hurt
because she was trying to save me.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.510
What's wrong?

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.630

I told her

that Su Yun got hurt

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.670

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.600
Then she criticized me

all my luck came to me.
