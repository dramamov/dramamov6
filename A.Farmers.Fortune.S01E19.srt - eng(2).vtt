00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.880
My father

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.280
is not real?

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.720
Why have you been lying to me?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.720
Xiaosheng.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.960
Calm yourself.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.920
Don't get us wrong.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.880
I have been trying...

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.740
Xiaosheng.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.820
Village Chief,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.860
perfect timing.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.860
A man insists he is my husband.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.700
How ridiculous!

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.900
I've driven him away.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.340
That is precisely why I'm here.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.020
He is the real Fu Qinghuai.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.540
That's impossible.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.020
The County Yamen's certificate

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.140
is right here in my hand.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.020
(Certificate of Proof)

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.180
The fake Fu Qinghuai is in my custody.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.540
Someone has accused you both

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.700
of plotting together

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.700
to seize the Fu Family's assets.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.500
This is a misunderstanding.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.380
Before I married into the Fu Family,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.780
I had never met my husband.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.300
How could I tell the difference?

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.980
I was completely deceived.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.180
Even so,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.140
there has been a formal accusation.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.300
I must handle this by the law.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.340
Take her away.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.380
Village...

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.300
Don't push me, I can walk myself.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.940
Get in.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.700
Qingqing.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.420
I've dragged you into this.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.220
So…

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.780
you truly are a mountain bandit?

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.500
Why would you think that way?

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.660
Aside from believing I'm a wanted man,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.860
I can't imagine any reason

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.500
you'd impersonate Fu Qinghuai.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.420
I'm not a wanted man.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.460
My real name

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.980
is Su Yanjin.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.980
Su Yanjin.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.980
(Tall bamboos tower above lofty flowers.)
Could it be

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.780
the great scholar Su Yanjin's work?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.540
Su Yanjin.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.980
So you are that famed great scholar,
Su Yanjin?

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.500
Famed scholar? Exaggeration.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500
For three generations,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.980
my forebears were military commanders.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.060
Yet I never cared for swordplay.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.500
I want to serve in the Imperial Court

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.720
to realize my ambitions.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.500
But my father

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.060
went so far as to bribe the examiner.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.620
My exam paper was swapped out.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.220
I found out about it,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.700
so I went to confront my father.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.060
Yanjin.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.620
Before the ancestral memorial tablets,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.340
as your father, I ask you this,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.420
will you admit your fault?

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.420
What wrong have I done?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.980
It is you, father,

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.140
who stopped me from serving in office

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.780
by resorting to such tactics.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.060
That is the true wrong here.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.620
Very well.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.060
You still dare to talk back.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.620
You've defied me.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.980
You unfilial child.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.060
This lash

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.060
is to punish your defiance.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.500
Such behavior is unfilial.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.340
This lash

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.620
is to punish your abandonment
of the ancestral career.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.340
Such behavior is disloyal.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.220
I'll ask you one last time.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.500
Do you admit your mistake or not?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.780
It wasn't my fault.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.860
I will not admit it.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.620
Then I'll make you admit it.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.500
How dare you abandon the family career?

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.780
How dare you talk back?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.340
Will you own up or not?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.620
(It's like when family forced a change)

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.620
(of college major.)

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.220
So,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.220
those marks on your body

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.580
are from your father's hand.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.220
He struck far too harshly.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.620
To him,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.940
going against his wishes

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.980
is the gravest sin imaginable.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.500
I will not bend to his will.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.100
So I left home.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.880
Unexpectedly, I crossed paths with bandits.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.580
My wounds hadn't yet healed

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.870
and was outnumbered.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.070
Later, inside their stronghold,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.580
I met Fu Qinghuai,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.500
who had also been taken by the bandits.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.820
We became close confidants.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.980
One day, I learned

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.060
the officials were to wipe out the bandits.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.180
So I fled with him.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.180
And then…

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.820
In the end…

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.820
how did you end up escaping alone?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.980
- Quick, Su!
- Right.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.460
- Stop there!
- Hurry, Su!

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.660
Stop right there!

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800
Stop!

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.660
Watch out!

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.980
Fu!

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.260
Fu!

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.500
Stop right there!

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.620
Don't run!

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.940
Stop!

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.930
Fu.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.340
Fu, stay with me.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.420
I'll fetch a physician.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.620
No...

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.260
I can't make it.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.940
Su.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.980
To save you,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.780
I have no regrets.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.100
It's just...

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.180
In the days to come,

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.540
please look after my family.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.260
Alright.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.340
You have my word.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.460
Fu...

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.980
Fu...

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.620
So many times.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.820
I've tried so many times.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.100
I wanted to tell you,

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.540
I'm not Fu Qinghuai,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.180
but Su Yanjin.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.610
But I just couldn't say it.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.420
Why?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.700
Because once I speak out,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.370
I'm no longer the father to the children

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.820
nor your husband.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.640
Young Master, it's me.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.980
Come on.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.940
I'll take you away.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.540
No.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.460
I can't leave.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.780
If I go,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.140
the charges will be confirmed.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.260
Then the two children

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.540
will have nothing to do with me.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.100
I saw Fu die with my own eyes.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.380
That Fu Qinghuai must be an imposter.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.980
I know something's not right.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.220
But he's holding official papers.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.660
He can claim the right to be

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.540
Fu Qinghuai

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.380
and seize the kids and the family estate.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.060
So,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.380
I must expose him in an open way.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.940
Young Master, stop talking.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.220
Someone will show up.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.560
Your crime of impersonation can't be cleared.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.380
Why stay here only to be punished?

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.820
Only if you get out

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.620
will my innocence be proved.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.060
I won't let you face this alone.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:06.860
No matter what happens,

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.540
I'll face it with you.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.660
Brother.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.260
Why did you quarrel with Mother?

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.140
And that man there...

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.660
Tangbao.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.940
I'm your own brother, right?

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.740
Yeah.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.380
Then from this moment on,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.300
trust no one but me.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.260
Son, hurry.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.620
Untie this for me.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.700
How can you prove you're my father?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.620
Well…

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.620
if I weren't your father,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.060
would I dare

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.820
to return so openly?

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.260
Why else would they

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.820
catch that swindler?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.620
I've been away from you for many years.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.180
It's my fault I let you down.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.340
But…

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.300
I've come back now.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.460
I…

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.300
I am truly your father.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.540
Look.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.660
Take a closer look.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.300
Am I right?

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.620
I recognized you.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.940
You're my father.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.700
Yes... yes.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.580
I'll take you to a wonderful place.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.260
We'll live a better life.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.220
Qingqing.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.340
Xiaosheng.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.300
Don't be afraid.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.460
Come home with me.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.500
Let go!

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.660
What are you doing?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.500
Auntie, he's my real father.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.260
What nonsense is that?

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.340
Your mother'd be heartbroken
to hear that.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.220
Come on.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.700
They've been lying to me all along.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.300
They were never my parents.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.060
Ungrateful child.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.500
Is how your parents

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.140
have treated you not clear to you?

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.540
That's enough.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.460
I...

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.500
We only just reunited.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.820
And you want to tear us apart.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.020
I don't strike women.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.540
If you don't leave,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.740
I'll call the officials.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.620
Go, quickly.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.380
Father, when will you take us away?

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.460
Be patient.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.380
I have some matters to attend to first.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.260
Afterwards,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.260
I'll take care of that shameless couple.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.620
Then I'll take you to another place.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.980
We'll live a good life.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.340
Does that sound good?

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.620
Let's have dinner first.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.500
I'll make noodles for you, Father.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.580
Good kid.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.940
You've got some skill.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.020
The spices are well balanced.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.820
Stay home and wait for me.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.780
Brother.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.540
Tangbao.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.500
Help me with something.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.380
No, you've changed.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.860
Do you want to save Father and Mother?

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.460
(Next Episode)
Tomorrow in the Court Hall,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.220
you must insist

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.260
that He Qingqing conspired
with her lover

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.620
to seize wealth and take lives.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.240
I will end you.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.540
I swear I'll put an end to you.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.180
So you admit

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.620
that you're not the father
of Xiaosheng and Tangbao.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.900
Are you?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.660
I hold the official document.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.480
No need to prove myself.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.860
You're not my father.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.860
You're a killer.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.660
For the Fu Family,

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.900
please don't hide the truth anymore.
