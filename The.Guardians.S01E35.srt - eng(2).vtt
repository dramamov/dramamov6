[2003, Eastern China, Yunlai Village]

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.140
Up next,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.410
acting major students
from the Academy of Drama

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.020
will perform

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.660
a monologue excerpt

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.330
from Romeo and Juliet.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.260
Romeo, why must you be Romeo?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.730
A rose, even by another name,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.850
would still smell as sweet.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.450
It's only your family name
that I despise.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.340
Without Montague, you'd still be you.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.220
What kind of line delivery is that?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.540
So over the top.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.820
Slow down.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.980
Comrade Ding Yi,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.540
your partner, Mr. Gu Yangshan,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.540
passed away

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.100
at Taipei Veterans General Hospital
in 1973.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.380
As of today,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.100
the thirty-year confidentiality period
has ended.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.540
Before his final moments,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.540
his last instruction

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.540
was to deliver this

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.820
into your hands.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.220
The geese flying south,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.100
at last,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.660
have returned north.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.930
Mr. Cao.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.340
When the Communist Luo Han

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.730
was meeting his handler, Xian Biyun,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.580
I caught them

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.100
and took them both down.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.660
They fell from the rooftop.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.780
Mr. Cao.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.100
Sit down, have a seat.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.810
Tell me,

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.810
what happened?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.220
Mr. Cao.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.540
No matter how we calculated,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.340
we never thought Luo Han
was a Communist.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.900
Last night, while I was monitoring,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.540
I picked up signals
from a mysterious radio.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.460
So I checked with someone
from the Cipher Division.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.340
Turns out it was a new radio

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.100
Deputy Chief Luo applied for days ago.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.900
Did you know about that?

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.020
He claimed it was
for some secret mission.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.460
A brand new radio?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.540
Well,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.900
so you didn't know either.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.580
Tell me this,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.100
with radios in the station unused,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.580
he applied for a new one instead

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.540
and sent out his own private codes.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.700
If that's not colluding with the enemy,
what is?

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.900
He didn't file a backup
with the Confidential Office.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.020
Well, he did file one,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.810
but it was a fake record.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.540
I noticed that after sending a telegram,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.340
he called the Confidential Office.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.660
I forcibly took

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.460
this codebook from his hands.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.020
But when I compared it with the message,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.100
not a single word matched.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.250
Mr. Cao,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.100
falsifying intelligence work

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.340
is an act of treachery.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.460
So I want to ask you,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.700
based on this alone,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.140
do I have the right to take him out?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.340
How could that be possible?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.580
What about the people he brought?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.580
They're all dead.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.340
At first, I thought

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.100
it was just the two of them
meeting in secret,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.580
but after I got into
a shootout with them,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.140
his accomplices came charging out.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.660
This is my gun.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.900
Out of bullets.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.930
This is

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.900
taken from his remaining men.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.900
Also used up.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.660
I got lucky.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.220
I made it out alive.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.810
The rest are gone.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.810
All of them are gone.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.580
Deputy Chief Luo is a Communist,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.850
but he's taken down
so many other Communists.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:33.890
He...

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.530
There's something you don't know.

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.460
Even though he killed Communists,

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.340
he's also once betrayed us.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.770
Years ago,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.010
he was taken to Yuyin Pavilion
by Sasaki.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.220
When he was imprisoned there,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.770
he sold me out.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.180
Report.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.610
Checked and verified.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.980
The bullet
in the female Communist's chest

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.610
was indeed from Director Gu's gun.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.770
It was Director Gu who killed her.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.650
You sure?

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.250
No mistake about it.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.250
Deputy Chief Luo made it clear,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.130
every bullet in Director Gu's gun

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.370
must be specially marked.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.250
Everyone in that building died
from those bullets,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.530
including Xian Biyun.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.530
I had already marked his issued bullets

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.180
back at the Bureau.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.610
Even if you kill me,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.010
Gu Yangshan won't escape the blame.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.700
Wait... hold on.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.530
What did you just say?

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.180
My bullets were marked?

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.250
Show me.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.650
The two of us

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.010
will both die under Gu Yangshan's gun.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.370
What are you doing, Xian Biyun?

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.420
Mr. Cao.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.130
The Party-State still doesn't trust me.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.370
Yangshan.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.130
It's not that we don't trust you.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.370
Deputy Chief Luo is a Communist.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.010
No one really believes it.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.300
The Communist Party
is about to enter the city.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.370
And now, at this moment,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.890
he lands me in such a huge mess.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.730
What terrible timing.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.850
What terrible timing.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:44.770
Yangshan.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.370
There are still many matters
at the Bureau.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.770
I need to wrap them up.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.530
As for Deputy Chief Luo's betrayal,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.250
we'll investigate later.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:54.890
Alright.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.940
Fall back.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.060
Yangshan, once the scene is settled,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.130
get back here right now.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.130
Pull the team back.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.650
Alright.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.530
They've all left.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.610
Where's the codebook?

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.370
The one I got was a fake.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.060
The real one must still be with Luo Han.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.770
I'll find it.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.250
Alright.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.220
Go get it, now.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.890
I'll head back right away.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.650
I'll send it to you once I get it.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.770
Then you get ready to send the message.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.650
Got it.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.250
I'll go prepare right now.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.490
I'm sorry.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.890
We have to find that codebook.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.370
We can't let Biyun's sacrifice
be for nothing.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.650
I swear on my life.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.580
I swear I'll finish my mission.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.890
Don't swear on your life.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.420
You can't die.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.650
You're the only one left.

For the cause of Communism.

For the cause of Communism.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.250
For the cause of Communism,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.340
I will fight till the very end.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.090
Mr. Cao.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.730
All of Luo's files have been cleared,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.810
but the codebook is missing.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.900
I can't worry about that now.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.490
The Public Security Headquarters lost.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.570
The 51st Army turned against us.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.620
The Communist Forces
have reached the Suzhou River.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.140
Listen.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.810
Right now, at the airport,

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.380
there's one last plane
leaving for China Taiwan.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.570
I've got two seats reserved on it.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.810
If we don't go now, it'll be too late.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.330
I've devoted my whole life
to the Party-State.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.290
I thought it'd take care of me
in my old age.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.140
Never imagined

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.290
I'd be the one to see its last days.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.250
But Mr. Cao,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.810
Director Mao personally arranged

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.570
remarkable people
for the scorched earth tactic.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.050
One day,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.570
if the Party-State retakes the mainland,

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.050
they'll be outstanding
intelligence agents.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.530
Enough.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.380
But…

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.380
Luo has betrayed us.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.900
He's surely handed that list
to the Communist Party.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.010
If we don't have the battle cipher,

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.380
we can't get in touch with them.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.810
Then they'll all be wiped out.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.290
Mr. Cao.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.050
What if everyone's gone by then?

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.730
I just remembered something.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.490
Luo had a box loaded on the plane early.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.660
Let's look for it there.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.140
Come on, let's move!

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.380
Why are you spacing out?

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.900
The headlights are out.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.380
Forget the headlights.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.380
Just go, now.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.900
Hurry up, everybody.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.620
Last five minutes!

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.010
Hurry up.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.770
I can't wait anymore.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.770
Hurry up.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.140
Watch it.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.090
That's Blue-and-White Porcelain.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.530
All of Luo Han's luggage is here.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.530
Yeah, it's all here.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.730
Go check for me again.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.770
There's really nothing else.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.770
Find it!

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:58.090
Alright.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.330
Yangshan, what else are you looking for?

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.900
The plane's about to take off.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.530
If we don't leave now, we'll miss it.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.810
The Communist Forces
will be here any minute.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.660
I still have a truck of belongings
not yet loaded.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.180
Inside there's something
from the Ming Dynasty.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.810
"Picture of the Heavenly Maiden
Scattering Flowers".

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.090
I barely snatched it from a traitor.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.730
It's worth a fortune.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.530
I'm willing to
leave the painting behind.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.090
And you're still hunting for a codebook?

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.330
You've lost your mind.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.290
Mr. Cao,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.570
without that codebook,
when we get to China Taiwan,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.730
how do we explain this to Director Mao?

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.530
Our Shanghai BIS
can't explain this away!

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.530
What's more important,
explaining or staying alive?

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.770
Talk!

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.370
There are a lot of enemy troops inside.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.050
And U.S. Military pilots too.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.940
Why don't we wait a little longer?

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.770
Our main force will be here any minute.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.610
No way.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.660
I have to go in.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.570
Reporting, Director Gu.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.130
We just checked at the airport.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.610
It seems Luo had two suitcases,

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.940
both filled with important documents.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.290
They were on the previous flight.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.570
That plane already left
for China Taiwan.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:34.850
What did you just say?

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.420
Isn't that fate?

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.660
Yangshan.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.610
The codebook got there ahead of us.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.420
Hurry, let's go.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.460
Move it!

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.850
Come on, go now.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.460
We'll be too late if we don't leave.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.610
Another truck's here.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.130
My painting.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.460
Come help carry this.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.900
Come on, help with these things.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.370
I didn't find it.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.130
It went to China Taiwan
on the last flight.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.420
I have to head to China Taiwan.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.770
Wait for my telegram.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.050
Don't let Comrade Biyun down.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.610
Gu Yangshan.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.290
Don't forget.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.610
You still have to be a teacher

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.530
and go to Peiping to find Miss Meng.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.850
You still have to live a new life
in the sunshine.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.420
Look.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.290
This is the land of our hometown.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.180
This is the crimson blood
of an old friend.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.460
Now it's my turn to protect it.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.370
So, Ding Yi,

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.050
I need you to do something for me.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.770
Please keep Miss Meng safe

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.610
and protect my homeland

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.130
and...

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.850
the new life under the sunshine.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.330
On the day China Taiwan is freed,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.850
put this on.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.570
No matter how much you change,

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.850
I'll still recognize you.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.530
Alright.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.370
Comrade Ding Yi,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.130
see you in the new China.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.180
See you in the new China.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.090
Luo Han's belongings.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.770
Mr. Cao,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.900
with this,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.850
our Bureau can report back
to Director Mao.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.660
Yangshan.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.290
Can you tell me

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.940
what your mission was
after you got to China Taiwan?

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.090
Playing dumb.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.420
Still pretending with me.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.370
I've actually known for a while.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.900
Xian Biyun and Luo Han
killed each other, right?

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.180
You tried to save them
but didn't make it in time.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:03.530
Am I right?

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.610
Mr. Cao, if you don't have proof,

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.050
you really shouldn't say that.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.770
This...

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.180
This could cost me my life.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.330
Maybe I don't know much,

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.130
but...

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.130
I'm pretty confident in reading people.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.530
Luo Han has killed so many Communists,

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.530
and yet the Communist Party went crazy,

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.660
even wanting to recruit him?

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.290
That doesn't mean
I had anything to do with it.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.610
Yangshan.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.530
Look, even though
the Ministry of National Defense

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.940
keeps shouting about counterattacking.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.530
Without support from the US,

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.660
the Chairman couldn't even
hold Guangzhou.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.420
If you ask me,

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.180
a wise man knows when to adapt.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.850
Once the plane lands,

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.330
I'll head straight to Director Mao

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.330
and back up the claim
that Luo betrayed us.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.610
If China Taiwan can't be held either,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.020
you vouch for me

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.180
that I contributed to the liberation.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.810
What do you say?

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.180
Mr. Cao.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.420
I've spent these years studying ciphers.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.530
If I really had that kind of skill,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.180
I'd say,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.530
you don't put me on a pedestal.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.570
Yangshan.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.180
I knew it since you were in school.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.130
You've always been a smart kid.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.420
After we get to China Taiwan,

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.770
we'll be starting over.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.610
We have to look out for each other.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.560
♪Flames dancing alone♪

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.250
♪Broken candle wax♪

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.100
What are you staring at?

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.820
You dropped something?

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.100
Sometimes I think,

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.620
if we were really family,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.580
that would be amazing.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.370
When the War of Resistance is over,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.010
let's find a place
with mountains and rivers.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.010
You can bring Miss Meng too.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:07.900
We could be neighbors.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.340
If you run out of oil, borrow from me.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.900
If I run out of flour,
I'll get it from you.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.130
And when we both have kids,

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.050
we can arrange for them
to be childhood sweethearts.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.130
If they're all girls or all boys,
it's fine.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.770
We'll just have them sworn in
as best friends.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.660
It's such a joyful day today.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.260
Let's take a picture together
as a keepsake.
