WEBVTT

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.680
You finally came.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.400
I know your child is seriously ill and needs treatment.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600
If you're willing to cooperate with me,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.480
I'm willing to cover the medical expenses.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.200
What do you want me to do for you?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.039
I'm here to apply for the cleaning job.

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.800
Come with me.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.440
Okay.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.760
I've drawn them all away.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.039
But we need to hurry,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.010
or they might show up at any moment.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.640
What should we do? It won't open.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.240
Liu, you were looking for me?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.039
No, I wasn't.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.759
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.160
But that cleaner clearly said...

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.960
Oh no.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.490
Do you have any wire?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.940
Preferably a long one.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.740
Will this work?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.400
Chunyu.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.920
You even know how to pick locks.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.850
That's amazing.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.000
Your child's condition has stabilized quite a bit.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760
After we complete the mission...

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.040
You can take her away now.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.720
Go.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.760
Don't run!

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.840
Stop!

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.400
Stop running!

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.320
Freeze!

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.160
Don't run!

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360
Stop right there!

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.120
Run!

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.960
How is that possible?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.040
Unbelievable.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.490
Detective Wang.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.480
I need you to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.160
look up Jiang Chunyu's parents' information

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.960
for me.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.640
Mr. Mu.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.280
Did you find anything?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280
Miss Jiang was taken

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.560
to the Gu family villa yesterday afternoon

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.020
and hasn't come out since.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040
She's probably being held captive.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.960
Gather everyone immediately.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.920
Come with me to rescue her.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.720
Wait, Mr. Mu.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.160
Miss Jiang

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.360
has already escaped.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.680
When did this happen?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.760
Are you sure?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.480
Yes,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.800
I've had someone watching the place.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.260
He saw it with his own eyes.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.180
He took a video.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.200
Jiang Chunyu.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.120
You won't even give me

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.450
a chance to be your hero.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.320
Grandpa.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.300
I heard Jiang Chunyu ran away.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.250
Don't you know how to knock?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.210
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.240
I was in a hurry.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.320
Sir.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.160
Jiang Chunyu.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.040
Wait a moment.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.140
Go back to your room first.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.959
Yes, Grandpa.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.440
Continue.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440
Jiang Chunyu's biological father

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.680
has no registered information.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.120
Her mother's name was Jiang Shuyun,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.840
who died in an accidental fall 10 years ago.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.520
However,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.200
she had changed her name before.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.330
Her original name was Jiang Mengting.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.520
So that means

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.690
Jiang Chunyu is my own granddaughter.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.840
Although the name and person match,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.880
we still can't be certain

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.940
that Jiang Chunyu is Gu Ming's child.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.440
This matter

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.810
must be investigated carefully and thoroughly.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.240
If the old man discovers

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.620
that Jiang Chunyu is his granddaughter,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.120
everything I have

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.820
will be taken away from me.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.040
No.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040
I won't accept it,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.040
and I absolutely won't allow it.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.200
Only if you die

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.280
can this secret be kept forever.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.320
Only then can I forever

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.450
remain the young lady of the Gu family.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.080
What happened?

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.080
Grandfather,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.960
what's wrong?

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.159
Please don't scare me,

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.480
Grandfather!

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.240
Miss,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.280
what happened to the master?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.040
I don't know what happened, but Grandfather

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.560
fell down the stairs.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.920
Call an ambulance, quickly!

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.720
Hello, emergency services?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.690
I've already paid the hospital bills.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.800
This doctor is an authority on heart disease.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.000
Perhaps he can help with her condition.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.610
You should give it a try.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.040
Chunyu,

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.520
I know I have no right

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.920
to ask for your forgiveness.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.720
All these years,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.320
I've been filled with regret.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.840
I hate my own cowardice,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.960
aiding the wicked,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.600
doing so many things that hurt you.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.680
I deserve to die.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.920
If regret were useful,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.159
then in this world

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.220
there wouldn't be so many tragedies.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.040
It seems I can't go back to the apartment for now.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.520
The Gu family will surely send people to intercept me.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.000
Now the only safe place

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.760
is just one location.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.280
Hurry!

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.120
Doctor,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.640
please save my grandfather!

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.400
He fell down the stairs.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.240
Miss Gu,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.920
please calm down.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.800
Let go first.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.760
You're wasting precious treatment time.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.920
No, doctor.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.920
I need to stay with my grandfather.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.080
If anything happens to my grandfather,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.720
I don't want to live either.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.159
Alright, please calm down,

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.920
Miss Gu.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.540
What are you doing?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.360
Let go!

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.490
Get out of my way!

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.800
Xiaomeng,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.920
what should we do?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.040
Grandfather,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.380
you can't leave us, Grandfather!

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.320
Grandfather,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.360
how did you end up like this?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.159
Grandfather!

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.240
Save him quickly! Wake up, Grandfather!

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.320
Grandfather!

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.960
You can't leave us,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.600
Grandfather!

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.690
I've been waiting all night

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.000
and you finally came.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.640
How did you know I would come?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.120
You're so smart.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.600
Of course you know

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600
what's best for yourself right now.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.840
The only one who can fight against the Gu family now

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.720
is me.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.720
So will you help me?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.919
Of course.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.480
If you hadn't escaped on your own today,

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.700
I would have already led people to fight the Gu family to the death.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.160
Qiushan.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.640
Why are you so good to me?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.200
Aren't you afraid I'm just using you,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.120
deceiving you?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.580
It doesn't matter.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.780
As long as I'm still useful to you,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.290
I can stay by your side forever.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.720
You fool.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.400
Then you

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.720
should make it up to me properly.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.410
All of you may leave now.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.040
I'll stay with Grandfather.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.760
Yes.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.000
You should go back too.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.080
You shouldn't stay up late.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.280
I can keep watch here.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.480
Tell me.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.000
Can the old man be saved?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.260
It would be better if he died tonight.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.120
Doctor.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.480
How is my grandfather?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.760
He's out of danger now.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.320
However,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320
he has a broken leg

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.480
and suffered a mild stroke.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.880
It might take a long time for him to recover.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.440
That's great news.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.220
Thank you, doctor.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.120
So,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.280
you want me to be your model.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.000
Mu Qiushan.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.120
Why don't you ask me

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.580
what really happened in the past?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.280
If you want to tell me,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.900
I'm willing to listen.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.680
It's a long story.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.000
But before that,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.120
I want to show you something.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.320
What?

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.640
Your eye...

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.080
How is this possible?

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.640
This eye of mine

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.200
was blind for exactly 10 years.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.420
During these 10 years,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.800
to survive

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.760
and to treat my eye,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.720
I collected garbage,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.720
worked as a salesperson,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.770
and even worked as a hospital aide.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.560
I was exhausted every day.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.040
But whenever I closed my eyes,

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.640
I...

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.080
I would...

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.800
I would see my mother

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.440
dying right in front of me.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.850
I couldn't sleep all night.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.560
I live only for revenge.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.520
If I can't avenge them,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.120
I have no reason to live.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.970
Someone like me,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.060
do you still want to love me

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.120
and spend your life with me?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.720
Why didn't you go to the police?

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.380
Because there's no evidence.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.840
And they were minors at the time.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.080
Even if they were convicted,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.690
nothing much would happen to the Gu siblings.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.960
I need to take revenge in my own way.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.680
Alright.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800
I promise to help fulfill your wish,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.560
no matter what it costs.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.880
You're awake.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.300
Did you sleep well?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.120
I slept well.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.530
Haven't slept this well in a long time.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.040
Then

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.240
move in with me.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.860
I guarantee you'll sleep this well every night.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.800
Okay.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.520
Got it.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.360
You agreed.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.500
I'm not the one losing out anyway.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.880
Let me be clear.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.780
I won't be paying any rent.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.440
Consider it

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.370
payment for being your life model.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.320
Uncle

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.360
Ms. Jiang

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.180
What are you two doing?

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.120
Come here, Weiwei.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.640
Where's Uncle?

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.040
He's with Ms. Jiang

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.850
having a heart-to-heart talk.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.160
Don't corrupt the child.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.320
Heart-to-heart talk?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.200
That sounds fun.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.240
Can I join you?

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.320
Uncle and Ms. Jiang are sharing their true feelings.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.120
Do you know what that means?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.480
I know!

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.560
You two are dating, right?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960
Mu Weiwei!

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:43.800
Ms. Jiang,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.640
are you going to be my aunt?

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.000
Ms. Jiang hasn't agreed yet.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.520
Weiwei,

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:51.840
could you

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.080
help your uncle out?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.480
This way

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.480
Ms. Jiang can always be with you.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.920
Plus,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.040
we can save on tutor fees.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.720
You're the CEO of the Mu Group

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.420
and you're being so cheap?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.800
You were just talking about true feelings

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.400
and now you're trying to take advantage of me.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.730
You're something else.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.680
Ms. Jiang,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.800
Uncle is stingy,

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.200
I can give you all my pocket money.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.760
Please don't be mad at him.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.360
Alright.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.800
To reward Weiwei today,

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.410
how about I cook something delicious for you?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.440
What about me?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.080
Come on.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.920
What about you?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.320
You can stay by yourself.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.680
You want to save on tutor fees

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.960
and now you want to save on a cook too?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.760
Let's go.
