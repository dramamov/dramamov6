=Episode 17=

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.880
What happened?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000
She talked back to you again?

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.920
It's all because of you.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.040
Look at yourself.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.520
That bracelet.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.430
You gave it to her.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.880
But why bring me up?

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.400
Feels like that cheeky girl
tricked me again.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.190
Dad.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.760
Just now, Cheng

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.680
asked me something.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.190
What?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.400
She said

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.400
she can't figure it out.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.590
Why, after Wenqian

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.680
came here,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.040
we all changed.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.820
She said

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.760
she hasn't done anything unforgivable.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.880
Then why did we

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.710
suddenly stop caring about her?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.500
Dad.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.920
I was just by the door

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020
watching Cheng walk farther away,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.500
like we drifting apart.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.620
I was just thinking

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.380
she's right.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.340
I used to care for her the most.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.540
You and Mom were busy.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.520
I was the one looking after her.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.820
Why?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.340
Why did I suddenly stop caring for her?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.180
I don't know why.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.630
It just hit me in my heart.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.260
It felt so heavy.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.820
Really heavy.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.900
It's all on me.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.840
What happened back then

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.260
is all my fault.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.940
I'm the one who made this home

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.060
turn out so messed up.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.140
I hurt you and Mom.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.900
I hurt Cheng too

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.180
and myself as well.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.540
Sometimes I wonder,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.980
what if you hadn't

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.060
brought Wenqian here?

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.700
You could've made it up differently.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.340
You shouldn't have brought her here.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.620
Stop overthinking it.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.260
That's all in the past now.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.780
No one's going to bring it up.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.660
Mr. Wu, I heard

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.900
you joined Changsheng
after graduation.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.820
And you've stayed for ten years.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280
Yes.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.670
I'd like to ask you about someone.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.340
Who?

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.820
Zhao Jun.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.980
(Wu Sen, Business Manager of Changsheng)
Zhao Jun?

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.700
He's Jian Wenqian's biological father.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.980
Zhao Jun was the Production Manager
at Changsheng

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.020
and my former leader.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.290
He passed away many years ago.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.700
He passed away?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.540
What happened?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.700
That year, he went to
Warehouse 2 to check inventory.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.680
Somehow,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.820
the wiring short-circuited.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.260
It triggered a fire.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.020
He was trapped inside for too long.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.420
They couldn't save him.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.260
The company covered up the incident.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.670
No one was allowed to talk about it.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.820
Later, Jian Hongyun
adopted Zhao Jun's daughter.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.540
Why?

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.140
They were college classmates.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.740
They shared a dorm room, bunk beds.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.540
They were close back then.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.420
After Jian Hongyun
took over the family business,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.260
he hired Zhao Jun immediately.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.220
Given how close they were,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.660
he adopting Zhao Jun's daughter

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.380
makes perfect sense.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.500
You were asking about Zhao Jun.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.640
Is something going on?

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.380
Mr. Wu,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.380
I'd like to ask for

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.500
your help with something.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.250
Mr. Wu,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.860
what did President Zhou want from you?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.980
Go ahead.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.940
First thing,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.260
find some old acquaintances from back then

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.940
and check the real cause
of the fire at Warehouse 2.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.420
Second, look into

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.580
what happened
after Zhao Jun's wife remarried,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.140
which was after Wenqian
joined the Jian Family.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.920
Will you take this on?

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.660
Of course.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.300
Zhao Jun's death was heavily covered up.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.740
Now his daughter's the second-in-command
at Changsheng.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.380
That is pretty strange indeed.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.140
This bracelet

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.060
looks nice, right?

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.380
Yeah.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.380
Jian told me today,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.420
he was going to give it to me.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.620
But Jian Youhui...

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.740
Youhui actually said,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.740
don't give it to me.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.900
He asked Jian

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.820
to keep it for Jian Wenqian.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.380
He said,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.380
I don't even like it.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.140
Can you believe that?

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.980
And then

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.500
they still expect me to support

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.380
their so-called romance

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.700
by complaining about Wang.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.020
I mean,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.940
he's got some nerve.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.740
So weird.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.340
Back then,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.950
my brother

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.180
knows exactly what I like

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.370
and what I don't like.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.860
Now tell me,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.500
how could he forget everything?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.460
Cheng.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.300
I feel like

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.180
you've changed somehow.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.340
Yeah.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.140
Lately, I think I've been

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.700
looking better and better.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.860
Every morning when I look in the mirror,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.940
I'm almost moved to tears by my beauty.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.620
That's not what I mean.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.860
I'm talking about

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.060
how you handle situations.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.540
The way you solve problems

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.540
has changed.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.420
You've grown more mature

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.740
and less impulsive.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.260
Mm-hmm.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.340
Because

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.060
Zhou Tingyan doesn't like me
getting into fights.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.260
He said,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.980
if I start fighting,

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.140
I'd end up hurt.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.980
If I get hurt,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.300
he'd feel bad for me too.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.300
So,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.100
from now on,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.340
I need to

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.420
win people over with kindness.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.820
I'm going to be

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.940
a graceful and classy Mrs. Zhou.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.620
Zhou Tingyan.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.540
Why're you so careless?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.620
What if you fall?

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.740
- I...
- Zhou Tingyan.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.180
Hey, listen to me.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.780
That Jian Youhui

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.940
is just so messed up.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.180
Can't even handle his own mess.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.860
He doesn't like Wang Niannian.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.660
So he asks Cheng

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.940
to make a scene in public.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.540
Is Cheng's face worth nothing?

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.420
If word gets out,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.940
how many will shame Cheng

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.940
or blame her for ruining Youhui's match?

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.300
Wouldn't that be so unfair to Cheng?

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.580
Meng Tang,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.540
thank you for today.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.300
The driver will take you home.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.020
Uh-huh.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.660
Zhou Tingyan.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.020
I'm here.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.060
I'm here.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.100
Zhou Tingyan.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.980
Zhou Tingyan.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.260
I'm right here.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.860
Zhou Tingyan.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.140
Can you

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.620
not be so nice to me?

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.020
Why?

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.620
Because Tang said

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.740
you might have a bit of a thing for me.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.380
Even if you do like me,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.060
please don't be this good to me.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.700
They

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.820
used to really care about me.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.980
But one day,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.460
suddenly,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.620
they just stopped caring.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.100
I'm afraid...

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.580
I'm afraid

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.500
that one day you'll be like that too

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.620
and suddenly stop being good to me.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.500
I won't.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.980
I won't.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.340
I won't.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.340
I won't.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.260
I won't.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.380
I never will.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.340
I never will.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.580
(Qin Zhuo)

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.060
(We can close in on Changsheng now.)

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.800
(Changsheng suspected of project corruption)

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.020
(Homeowners' rights violated)

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.580
If this isn't handled well,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.660
I can't keep my position at Changsheng.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.220
I know what value I have
in the Jian Family.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.020
Don't you still have Jian Youhui?

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.260
Jian Youhui is far from the best choice.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.300
Oh, right.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.300
That source.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.340
Give him a little warning.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.020
(Inbox: whistleblower;
Changsheng PR; local reporter)

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.960
(Next day)
The manager took kickbacks,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.900
passed off shoddy goods,

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.740
and cut corners.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.140
(Happy Daily)
How will Changsheng handle this?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.980
The manager of Shenghui's new project

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.540
failed to bribe our reporter

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.740
and resorted to violence.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.740
Was this also condoned by Changsheng HQ?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.620
Please answer.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.630
We need you to respond.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.490
Please answer.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.380
HQ is holding an emergency meeting.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.980
We will make sure all property owners

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.140
and everyone concerned...

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.180
Sorry, the person you calling

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.340
is busy making money.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.340
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.540
Send one even if it's not.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.610
Thanks.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.760
Hey.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.740
Cheng?

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.620
I remember,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.380
Qianyi had a partnership with the TV Station.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.260
Now things have blown up like this.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.500
Your dad means to

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.860
have Tingyan talk to the TV Station execs.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.380
Ask them to reason with that reporter.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.260
If even Jian couldn't handle it,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.740
the reporter must be tough to deal with.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.610
Why would Tingyan help him?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.340
Yes.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.340
You married Zhou Tingyan,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.490
but don't forget,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.850
you still carry the Jian name.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.460
Now the Jian Family is in trouble,

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.780
you should be stepping up to help.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.860
Why?

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.340
You only come to me when there's trouble.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.580
Jian Cheng,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.380
how does trouble at Changsheng
benefit you?

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.380
We're still your family.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.780
Without your family's support,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.860
how long will you shine
in the Zhou Family?

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.100
Zhou Tingyan.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.460
Mm.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.740
You've treated me the best.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.860
She hung up on me.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.220
You've never once hung up first.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.660
You always wait for me to hang up.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.220
Do you want more shares in Changsheng?

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.380
Tingyan.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.620
If something happens to Changsheng,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.500
it won't be good for Cheng either.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.580
Don't you agree?

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.660
At 9 am tomorrow,

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.860
you and Jian Youhui come meet me
at Qianyi.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.580
