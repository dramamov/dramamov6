00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.790
The people Zhang Zhen sent got taken down.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.790
Zhou Tingyan will soon
trace it back to you.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.250
I'll give you an account.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.390
Get out of sight for a while.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.780
(Li Shui, Jian Wenqian's uncle)

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.840
Why drag my people into this?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.900
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.760
Look what happened.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
The plan fell through.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.790
And they ended up caught.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.150
I admit I rushed things.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.640
Su Yun has to leave Jiangyu soon.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.950
We can't upset Director Mei.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.950
The film has to be made.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.920
If we lose this chance,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.040
by next time,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.790
Jian Cheng might already have a kid.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.740
Zhou Tingyan will only protect her more.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.760
You once told me

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.590
Jian Cheng was sold to the mountains.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.760
That must've left a deep scar.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.430
I just meant to scare her.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.490
Besides,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.920
Zhou Tingyan didn't follow up on it.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.760
That's enough.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.150
As long as it involves Jian Cheng,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.350
Zhou Tingyan will never let it slide.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.400
From now on, without my consent,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.790
don't contact my people again.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.790
(Maybe I can use her)

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.400
(to distract Zhou Tingyan for a while.)

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.190
My guys dug up something.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.840
Jian Wenqian's private accounts

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.910
is moving big sums overseas via Shenghui.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.800
Could she have sensed something?

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.960
With such a thing happening,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630
should I give Chairman Jian a heads-up?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.870
Letting Wenqian go abroad

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.430
was indeed my decision.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.080
It's also the best way to handle

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.430
her and Youhui's issues.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.630
The best way?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.030
I don't think so.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.240
What do you mean?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.150
All these years,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.310
Jian Wenqian has used the connections

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.870
of Changsheng
to pull in a lot of contacts.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.840
She's got big ambitions,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840
and she's capable too.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.310
If we send her abroad,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.120
it could come back to bite us.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.640
(Absolutely.)

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.150
(Half of Changsheng's resources
are in her hands.)

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.000
I think the best place for her

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.920
is away from the center of power,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.360
but still within our control.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.960
She handled the mess

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.840
Shenghui left behind well.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.280
To outsiders,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.430
it looks like Wenqian's been loyal
to Changsheng.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.800
After this,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.150
we can separate Shenghui and her
from Changsheng.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.710
Whatever happens to Shenghui and her

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.240
won't affect Changsheng anymore.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.120
Sacrifice the small

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.710
to protect the big.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.030
What could possibly happen to them?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.470
Chairman Jian,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.630
motives can be unpredictable.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.910
Whatever happens to Shenghui and her

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.630
won't affect Changsheng anymore.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.200
Dad.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.810
Dad.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.190
I just received a transfer notice.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.080
I know you're still upset with me

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.560
and don't want to see me anymore.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.590
I'll agree to go abroad.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.240
Changsheng Group's overseas project

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.630
needs further follow-up.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.360
I'll take it as a business trip.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.270
No need.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.910
Youhui is already on it.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.800
Shenghui needs someone in charge

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.630
to oversee the property rectification.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.150
If you really want to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.000
earn back your credit,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.870
go stay at Shenghui.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.480
Handle Shenghui's public image issues

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.760
and you'll have

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.680
the leverage to stand firm in the Group.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.070
But I...

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.240
Shenghui is a key branch of Changsheng.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.160
If you manage Shenghui well,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.430
it'll be yours in the future.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.510
(Zhou Tingyan.)

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.390
(It must be Zhou Tingyan again.)

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.560
Move the plan ahead.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.190
Since you know Wenqian is overly ambitious,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.390
why keep her in Changsheng?

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.630
That's not a smart move.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.000
Now everything is finally taking shape.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.240
But key evidence is still missing.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.430
If we let her slip abroad now,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.360
it's going to be tough

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.760
to catch her later.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.670
Wenqian.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.840
Didn't I tell you

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.750
to go to Shenghui this afternoon?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.270
Why are you still here?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.510
What a pretentious family.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.030
What's wrong?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.270
Now I'm useless to you, is that it?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.070
Or is it...

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.050
This time it's my turn, like Jian Cheng,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.720
to be the one sacrificed.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.760
Jian.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.190
(Jian Cheng)
If you want to know why I'm adopted,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.430
come back at 1 pm

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.950
and you'll know the truth.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.500
What does she mean by that?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.640
Jian Cheng.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.820
You think you're the one

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.160
who walked away from them,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.070
but actually,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.720
they sacrificed you for their own gain.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.870
Cheng.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We took Wenqian in back then

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.160
because

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.390
your brother made a mistake as a kid.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.270
That year,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.390
he was six years old.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.310
He couldn't stay put at home.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.600
So I brought him to Changsheng Group.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.000
I never expected

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.840
he...

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.630
accidentally started a fire,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.480
which led to Wenqian's biological father

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.680
losing his life in the flames.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.190
It was my lack of supervision

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.160
that caused this tragedy.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.440
It's all my fault.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.630
It's all my fault.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.830
That year when it happened.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.160
Changsheng Group was about to go public.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
If this gets out,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.240
it'll definitely hurt Changsheng Group.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.190
Back then, your dad

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.270
had just taken over Changsheng Group.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.000
It would've hit him hard too.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.240
But most importantly,

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.800
if the truth was exposed,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.830
it could affect your brother for life.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.350
And then?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.640
Later on,

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.560
your brother was already twelve,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.190
yet still trapped
in that fire's nightmare.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.380
His energy and spirit kept fading.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.930
So I resorted to

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.810
a fortune teller.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.590
He did a reading

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.310
and said,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.190
we need to atone for our sins.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.270
So I hurried to find Wenqian and her mom

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.190
and brought Wenqian back.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.070
And then later on,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.530
I became the daughter
Mom always dreamed of.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.240
But you

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.830
kept straying further from her plans.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.720
She loved taking me out

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.240
because it made her proud.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.240
After what happened in high school,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.030
she avoided taking you anywhere.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.960
She even thought

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.440
it'd be better if you never came back.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.670
That way,

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.880
when people talked about you,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.120
they'd only feel sorry for her,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.910
sympathizing with a mother
losing her child,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.030
instead of pointing fingers now, saying,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.240
"Look,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.910
Mei Lan's daughter

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.750
was taken deep into the mountains,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.030
was hurt by others.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.320
She lost her dignity

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.840
and suffered a mental breakdown.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.120
The reputation of the Jian Family

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.140
was completely ruined by her alone."

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.680
Mom,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.550
am I wrong?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.800
Jian Wenqian,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.080
you've lost your mind!

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.150
Yes.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.390
It's all my fault.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.870
I deserve the worst.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.960
I grew distant from my own daughter

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.910
and treated you, an adopted girl,
like royalty.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.910
But in the end,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.630
I raised you into someone so ungrateful.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.510
Karma really works.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.390
It's karma, no doubt.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.080
Does Grandma know

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.840
Jian Youhui's wrongdoing?

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.350
She knows.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.790
This is the mess you created.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.250
Why should I be the one to repay it?

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.870
You said Grandma knows.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.480
No way.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.200
Grandma definitely doesn't know.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.360
She even gave me her dowry,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.550
Changhuai Road, to me.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.200
She loves me the most.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.350
You're lying.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.120
Grandma doesn't love me out of guilt.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.360
She really doesn't.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.320
It's not because she's making amends.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.120
Jian, I'm giving up my shares
in Changsheng

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.120
and Changhuai Road too.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.870
I'm giving it all

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.000
to you.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.790
I'll get Zhou Tingyan to work with you.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.240
Just tell me,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.120
none of this is real, right?

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.870
No...

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.960
It's all my fault.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.910
I was difficult and willful.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.500
I was arrogant and overbearing.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.360
It's all my fault.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.750
Dad.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.150
Tell me.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.910
I'm not your…

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.240
sacrifice for atonement.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.080
Am I right?

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.750
I'm not a sacrifice for your gain,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.910
am I?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.840
Youhui.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.560
Youhui.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.840
Please, tell me.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.040
Liars.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.720
You're all liars.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.750
Cheng.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.260
Grandma doesn't love me to atone.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.600
I'm not a sacrifice.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.320
Grandma never saw me as the sacrifice.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.240
She's not like you people.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.200
Cheng.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.000
She's different.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.390
You're all liars!

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.620
Cheng.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.780
(Jian Cheng,)

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.770
(starting today, you'll see)

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.560
(what it means to lose everything.)

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.240
Mr. Zhou,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.100
Madam and Su Yun

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.940
are trending.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.330
What? Jian Cheng is

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.540
(Jian Cheng involved in Su Yun's romance)
the other woman.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.720
She got cheated on,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.740
so she got back on others.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.320
(Su Yun's financial backer Zhou Tingyan)

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.960
Pull that topic down now.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.800
Got it.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.240
- The number you dialed is not reachable.
- Hello?

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.720
Su Yun.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.180
You're behind that trend, aren't you?

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.550
Trend?

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.510
What trending topic?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.550
Please get your facts straight.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.720
Zhou Tingyan wanted to marry Jian Cheng.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720
She doesn't even know
your issue with him.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.630
It's Zhou Tingyan who owes you a debt.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.320
Why are you picking on Jian Cheng?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.320
- I...
- Didn't I warn you last time?

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.150
Fix things however you want,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.670
but leave Jian Cheng out of it.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.750
You'd better clear this up right now.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.540
Or even your brother can't save you.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.780
(Jian Cheng involved in Su Yun's romance)

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.360
What's going on with this trend?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840
Was this your doing?

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.510
How could I pull that off?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.590
Zhang Zhen.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.390
That wasn't a question.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.360
It was a statement.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.550
Your professionalism is seriously lacking.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.030
I finished shooting Director Mei's film.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.240
And you're making such a scene.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.550
What exactly do you want?

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.390
If things blow up,

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.390
what will happen to the film?

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.160
I promise,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480
it won't happen.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.670
Director Mei's film

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.870
will be released smoothly.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.440
You promise?

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.120
Zhou Tingyan is a married man.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.200
I, a trending star,
get tangled up with him.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.480
You sure nothing will happen?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.870
Or is it that you've got

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.790
another card up your sleeve?

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.440
I'm sure

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.030
because Zhou Tingyan

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.390
owes you.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240
He wouldn't ruin you.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.350
Owes me?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.280
You mean my brother.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.630
Indeed,

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.270
Zhou Tingyan gave me resources

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.360
because he felt guilty.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.510
So you made such a big move,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.630
even risking my career,

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.670
just to take that gamble,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.150
betting Tingyan will shield me
out of guilt and duty.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.030
Is that it?

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.840
Everything I did was for you.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.100
For me?

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.950
Do you even know

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.030
Zhou Tingyan hates being threatened?

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.790
Yet you forced him online.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.910
Doing this will only make him think

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.600
that I'm exploiting my brother's death

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.580
as leverage just to take from him.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.910
I'll clarify this myself.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.030
From now on,

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.030
don't intervene.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.550
Is Jian Cheng home?

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.390
Cheng just left.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.380
Has she seen the trend?

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.240
You mean…

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.320
The trending topic?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.630
She…

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.200
Maybe she hasn't checked her phone.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.200
Assistant Pan, what's with that trend?

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.120
Everyone, about the trending topic,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.480
you can check your phones.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.630
See the trending topic now.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.790
(Zhou Tingyan's first love)
Mrs. Zhou,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.030
Jian Cheng, is my first love.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.480
And beyond that,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.630
I have never loved anyone else.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.670
The reporters are upstairs.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.000
Miss Su.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.510
Don't mind me speaking frankly.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.030
Mr. Zhou is disappointed
in you this time.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.390
He's already told me

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.240
to start terminating Qianyi Group's

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.360
partnership with your studio

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.200
and related business projects.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.390
I'll be blunt.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.200
If you insist on going your own way,

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.390
you and Mr. Zhou might...
