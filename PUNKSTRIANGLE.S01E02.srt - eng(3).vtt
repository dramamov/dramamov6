00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.458
Just walk right past?

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:13.875
Good. Let's get a few more shots.

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.042
Great, great.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:20.958
I used to just walk straight ahead...

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:25.667
Staring down the lens was second nature...

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.952
But the needle of the sewing
machine followed a curve,

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:31.958
and it pierced me.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.500
That's when I realized...

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:46.417
some people just aren't
cut out for certain things.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.583
But...

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:08.667
the dress Sumiura made...

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.250
was so delicate, so pure...

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.250
so beautiful.

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.875
"PUNKSâ–³TRIANGLE"
(Episode 2)

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.083
Let me see you to the door.

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:35.417
Thank you.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.875
Thank you.

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:44.208
Thank you for coming.

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.625
I'm so glad I found something I like.
Thank you so much.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.750
Please come again.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.375
Thank you for your purchase.

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:50.917
Manager.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.625
Sumiura-kun seems to be
in a great mood, doesn't he!?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.750
Yeah.

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:55.500
Manager.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.542
We're out of the chain necklaces.
Can I place another order?

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:01.667
Absolutely! Go for it.

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:05.250
Hasegawa-san,
I can handle that inquiry from earlier.

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:07.750
Thanks.

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:11.917
Manager.

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:15.417
Sumiura-kun... he just
called me "Hasegawa-san"!

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:18.083
That's great, isn't it?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.917
I've read that DM over and over.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.458
But I still can't believe it.

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:33.292
AE didn't just notice me,

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:41.083
we even had an indirect kiss.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.458
With this momentum, the
competition should be a breeze.

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.375
So, for the competition...

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.167
Let's nail down the concept, Enaga!

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.500
Enaga, did you finish the design
sketches for the competition?

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:03.000
Yeah...

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:05.958
Then... let's show each other.

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:09.458
You seem to be in a pretty
good mood, Sumiura-kun.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.000
You think so?

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.083
Here.

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:18.542
Huh?

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:27.417
Enaga, let's submit our
designs to the teacher separately.

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:29.625
And then we'll make
whichever one gets approved.

00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:34.333
Now that's the Sumiura I know...

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:43.083
I knew you'd be here.

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:48.000
Nakano-sensei, sorry to
bother you on your break.

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:50.143
Could you take a look at these for us?

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:51.583
Sure.

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:56.917
Ah...

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:03.417
Um...

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:06.083
Sumiura-kun.

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:09.917
This won't work at all.

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:11.875
Huh?

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:16.083
I can definitely feel
your passion for punk.

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:21.708
But the theme for "Fashion Navigation" this
time... is "Human Connection." Do you understand?

00:05:21.796 --> 00:05:23.292
Yes, of course.

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:26.792
Punk fashion has an aspect
of sharing a rebellious spirit.

00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:28.750
So in that sense, punk also...

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.875
You've got it backwards.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.000
Huh?

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:38.333
You wanted to do punk,
so you're just forcing the theme to fit.

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:47.708
Have you seen Enaga-kun's collage
and concept notes?

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:52.000
No, just the design sketch.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:59.583
First, you need to
properly "connect" with him.

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:06.083
Yes...

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:13.542
Thank you, sensei.

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:34.167
It's true, I was only thinking about what
kind of clothes I wanted AE to wear, and...

00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:36.917
Sorry for the wait!

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.542
After meeting AE, I was on cloud nine.

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.833
This is no good. I need to get it together.

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:55.333
Sumiura-kun.

00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:03.792
Sorry, Enaga.

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:06.875
Let me see your inspiration notebook again.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.500
Okay.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.208
The streets... at night.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:20.625
I think nighttime is when people connect.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.583
People with different jobs,
wearing different styles of clothes,

00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:25.750
sit side by side, drinking together.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.792
I wanted to capture that feeling of an
instantaneous connection between people

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:35.083
and put it into the clothes.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.875
I see.

00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.417
This design sketch...

00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:46.875
is depicting the light spilling out
from the shops at night.

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:50.375
Still...

00:07:54.125 --> 00:08:01.167
his choice of photos, color
schemes, and composition...

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:03.333
is just undeniably impressive.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:08.500
Enaga, you've got great taste.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.750
But I feel my design is too plain.

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:18.208
Sumiura-kun's is much
more suited for the stage.

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:22.167
I was wondering if I should
try a different approach.

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:23.917
True.

00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:27.083
It might need a little more "playfulness."

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:30.625
A night out.

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:37.917
Let me teach you what a real night out is.

00:08:39.292 --> 00:08:42.917
Hey, what about "a night out"?

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:45.167
A night out...

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That's good. It's more positive and active.

00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:55.458
Going out at night is an act of making
instant connections with all kinds of people.

00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:58.000
And besides...

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:03.500
Going out for the first time...

00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:06.458
I think that takes a lot of courage.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:09.417
So...

00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:13.667
the clothes that become
your "pillar of courage"...

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:16.292
I hope the clothes I make...

00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:21.250
can also be that source
of courage for someone.

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:26.833
Let's make clothes that give people
the courage to get closer to each other.

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:29.042
Sounds great.

00:09:31.917 --> 00:09:33.458
So what are we doing today?

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:34.863
Finish the design sketches here?

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.667
Or should we do some research...

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:39.667
We're going out, of course!

00:09:58.458 --> 00:10:02.042
Enaga, have you ever been to a club?

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:04.333
Um...

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:08.000
Don't worry.

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.417
I'll be your nightlife guide.

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:14.167
Please, lead the way.

00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:16.708
By the way,

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:19.125
what kind of club do you think
would suit Enaga?

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.450
Is it that thing that turns
into two pairs of scissors?

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.083
That's the character for plum blossom!

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:25.750
The club I usually go to is...

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:29.125
This is it.

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:33.917
You okay? Nervous?

00:10:34.042 --> 00:10:36.708
No, I'm fine.

00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:44.583
It's gonna be loud when I open
the door, so don't be startled.

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:46.667
Thanks.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.000
What is this?

00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:28.583
Looks like a live performance
mixed with a painting event?

00:11:28.708 --> 00:11:32.125
Hey, if you wanna join in,
you gotta buy a T-shirt first.

00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:37.708
I see, so it's mainly
about selling T-shirts.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:40.273
Are you kidding me? They're
really doing something this lame?

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:43.958
Sumiura-kun, isn't this your usual spot?

00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:46.167
Well... yes, it is.

00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:50.458
But I wore my favorite jeans today.

00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:54.792
They even sell pants. Come on, let's have
fun. This is what a night out is all about.

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.667
Let's go, Sumiura.

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:33.000
Amidst the booming music and neon lights...

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:36.583
vivid paint splattered everywhere.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.500
I never knew...

00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:44.625
that under a blacklight,
a white T-shirt would glow aqua blue.

00:12:54.417 --> 00:12:56.250
Sorry...

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:07.917
Enaga! I'm gonna make your T-shirt
the ugliest in the world.

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.708
Sumiura-kun, right back at you.

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:23.542
No! You can't do that.

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:26.958
Hold on.

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:39.042
What is happening?

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:43.542
I'm in the same place I
was with AE yesterday,

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.708
having the same kind of night out,

00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:52.417
but it feels completely different.

00:13:57.208 --> 00:13:58.667
It's so weird.

00:14:28.542 --> 00:14:29.375
What's wrong?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.375
"Sumi-ura?" That's so lame!

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.083
Poop-colored~

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:36.208
That's because you smeared
every single color on me, Enaga.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:40.458
Enaga, for some reason,
you actually look more stylish like this.

00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:42.463
Is that supposed to be a
backhanded compliment?

00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.458
Enaga, a belly button ring...

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.542
I'm surprised, Enaga. Didn't
take you for the type to have one.

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:59.292
A slob like you with a belly button ring...

00:14:59.417 --> 00:15:01.083
It's kinda hot?

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.958
Don't get cocky.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.542
And when you're changing, you
could at least take off your hat, right?

00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:10.625
Stop staring, it's embarrassing.

00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.208
What's there to see?

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.708
You're surprisingly toned.

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:32.458
Compared to you, I
feel kinda self-conscious.

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.083
Sumiura, you've got paint on your back.

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:28.000
- Here...
- You little...

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.375
Is it off yet?

00:16:35.542 --> 00:16:37.583
Almost... there.

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:51.125
You're... so clumsy.

00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:53.792
Sorry.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.958
Mmm.

00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:25.208
Stop it...

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.208
Just a little more...

00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.000
Hurry up!

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:56.083
This kind of feels like a date.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.958
Huh? A date with you?

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:02.000
It's fun.

00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:04.958
I'm not having fun at all.

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:06.333
Really?

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:10.208
So, how was it?

00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:12.213
Did you get any inspiration
from our night out?

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.750
What about you?
Wasn't it your first time?

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:22.167
Since it was with you, Sumiura,
my first night out was amazing.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.667
Even if I ended up covered
in poop-colored paint.

00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:28.083
I told you to drop it.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.667
Poop-colored, poop-colored.

00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:31.792
Wait!

00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:40.208
Being with you is seriously exhausting.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.000
Oh... no.

00:18:48.333 --> 00:18:50.875
Uh... what's his name again?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.708
The model for this competition... AE?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
He's still pretending he doesn't know me...

00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:03.375
So cute...

00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:11.292
If we win this competition,
we can get him to wear our design.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.726
Would that really make you happy?

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.958
Of course!

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:19.750
Wait... Isn't it because of AE?

00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:21.167
That's not why I said it!

00:19:21.292 --> 00:19:24.292
Look! Of course I'd be
happy to win the competition.

00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:25.917
Hmm...

00:19:31.792 --> 00:19:35.250
Hey, Sumiura Chiaki.
Do you have a 'bias'?

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:36.542
A bias?

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.417
Yeah, a bias.

00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:41.875
No, I don't.

00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:44.375
I see.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.792
Enaga Ayumu, what about you?

00:19:46.917 --> 00:19:48.708
Do you have a bias?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.417
Maybe... I do.

00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:57.083
What do you mean, 'maybe'?

00:19:59.292 --> 00:20:04.125
Well, my place is this
way. See you at school.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.292
W-Well then...

00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:05.000
Sumiura Chiaki... We've
been together for so long.

00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:07.792
And you haven't noticed at all.

00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:12.375
I never thought...

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.250
I'd be deceiving you like this.

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:19.458
Could you show me
some of your previous design work?

00:21:19.583 --> 00:21:22.292
But every time I see your innocent side...

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:23.833
It's a night out, right?

00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:26.125
Let me show you
what a real night out is like.

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:30.208
It makes me want to
gently stroke your chin.

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:36.625
But for some reason, I also want
to completely shatter that innocence.

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:42.208
You... You haven't taken it off yet?

00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:45.542
It feels so strange.

00:21:47.417 --> 00:21:52.917
I never thought I'd run into Sumiura Chiaki
'here' too.

00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:03.601
"Thanks so much. I'll let you
know once the schedule is set."

00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:06.265
- "I'm counting on you then~
- We're having 'that' party tomorrow!"

00:22:07.042 --> 00:22:08.458
Tomorrow...

00:22:39.542 --> 00:22:43.208
For some reason... I feel really happy.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.542
This kind of feels like a date.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.417
No, what am I saying? A date?

00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:05.000
You've got paint on your back.

00:23:14.458 --> 00:23:16.167
What am I even thinking?

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:28.667
"Chiaki-kun, are you free tomorrow night?"

00:23:51.792 --> 00:23:53.250
"I'll be there."

00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:12.250
I can see AE again.

00:24:17.125 --> 00:24:22.083
Yes! I get to see him. I get to see him!

00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:32.476
(Next Episode)
Wow~ I'm going for drinks with AE now.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:32.875
Let's go.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.500
If my body won't listen,
I'll just follow my heart.

00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:37.458
It's like I have AE all to myself.

00:24:37.583 --> 00:24:38.833
It feels a little naughty.

00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:40.292
He taught me so many things.

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:41.601
The first time my heart skipped a beat.

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:44.458
By the way, Chiaki, is
there someone you like?
