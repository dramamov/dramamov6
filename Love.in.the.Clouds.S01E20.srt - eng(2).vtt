00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.000
Your Lordship!

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.350
Your Lordship.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.070
What is this?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.790
What happened?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.120
I killed him.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.470
What?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.560
I killed him.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.000
Your Lordship,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.520
even if you wish to help Ming Yi,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.750
you must look after yourself.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.960
I'm fine, Fuyue.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.470
Don't worry.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.080
I'm perfectly fine.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.560
Come on.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.310
Your Lordship,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.030
you've opposed Mu Qibai time and again

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.150
for Ming Yi's sake.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.030
I fear you've already become a thorn in his side.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.360
Mu Qibai has more than one enemy.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.560
The enemy of my enemy is a friend.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.560
Since that's the case,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.710
I'll lend this friend a hand.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.120
The Judgment Hall reports

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.190
that you abducted Fairy Ming Yi

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.560
and even carried out a private punishment.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.910
Is that true?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.400
Through investigation, I discovered

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.030
that Ming Yi carried spiritual veins,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.520
and Ji Bozai concealed and sheltered her,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.710
so naturally, I had to get to the bottom of it.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.800
It's true she has spiritual veins,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.590
but the one who covered up for her wasn't Ji Bozai.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.120
It was me.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.000
I've long intended for her to serve at Shouhua Academy.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.750
Absurd!

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.910
A fairy born with spiritual veins

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.120
is a jinx,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.430
yet you want to bring her into Shouhua Academy?

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.560
Such a foolish rule

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.870
should have been broken long ago.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.830
Soon,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.270
as the Venerable of Shouhua Academy, I will decree

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.480
that all women within Jixing Abyss who bear spiritual veins

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.550
need not hide any longer

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.640
and may compete to be warriors.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.230
Uncle, instead of worrying

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.510
about such a trivial matter,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.160
perhaps you should explain

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.360
why a charred corpse

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.800
found in this case

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.590
came from Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.030
He's dead?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.470
Who

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.120
was he?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.800
Whoever he was,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.950
it's not your place to question me.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.590
Then never mind

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.910
the corpse.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.000
But think about this, Uncle.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.120
Why did the Judgment Hall

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.390
report this matter to me so quickly today?

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.710
Uncle,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.950
Jixing Abyss

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.710
is no longer yours to control alone.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.470
Uncle Qibai is growing ever more brazen,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.560
even consorting with people from Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.390
Your Highness,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.080
what should we do next?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.800
Now

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.320
that the Judgment Hall no longer obeys Lord Hanfeng,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.590
can we not accuse him directly?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.880
Though he is no longer what he once was,

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.390
it's still not easy to bring him down.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.590
We must awaken my father,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.950
no matter

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.760
what it takes.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.470
You really don't understand your master.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.560
He'd never turn his back on Ming Yi.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.320
You're so loud.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.080
Last night, His Lordship

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.950
took your master's fiancée

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.590
to the hot springs to heal and keep warm.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.120
Instead of gossiping here,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.640
you'd better keep an eye out

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.440
before your master ends up getting cheated on.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.680
I can't be bothered.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.950
It's not me who'll get cheated on.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.390
Th... thanks.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.320
You may dislike us most of the time,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.640
but knowing the danger, you went with me

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.240
to Dragon Carp Terrace to rescue them.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.390
You're actually a decent person,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.710
loyal when it counts.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.680
If you had gone alone and been caught,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.000
you might not have withstood the torture

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.510
and revealed secrets about Wugui Sea.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.470
That would've brought real trouble upon His Lordship.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.680
Besides,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.030
when His Lordship was struck by the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.590
Fairy Ming Yi helped us.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.080
So by that reckoning,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.200
I owe her one.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.030
Then by your logic,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.800
since you helped me beat Sun Liao,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.800
I owe you a favor too.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.630
- No need... - How about this?

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.350
I'll grant you three wishes.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.880
No need.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.200
Don't make a big deal out of it.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.800
Tell you what,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.950
for the first wish, I'll go fishing with you.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.030
Sounds like you're the one who wants to fish.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.120
And don't you dare

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.000
steal my dried fish again.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.830
Fine.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.270
That counts as the second wish.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.950
What?

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.200
Very well.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.950
Then you'll buy the fishing rods.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.950
I just sent a message to Master She,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.590
asking him to study

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.640
the Soul-seizing Technique

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.470
to see if it can suppress the Heavenly Grief,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.270
since you used your spiritual veins

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.510
but didn't suffer any aftereffects this time.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.560
Thank you for worrying about me.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.560
Why are you being so polite?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.200
You...

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.680
What's wrong?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.760
Ming Yi,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.120
no matter how much you like him,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.350
stay focused on what truly matters.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.830
You have only one life.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.590
True.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.080
If one dies,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.680
any amount of love won't matter.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
When I finally steal the Golden Millet Dream,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.800
he'll think I've been lying to him all along

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.800
and will hate me for it.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.080
And everything will be over.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.160
♪I thought no one lived as freely as I do...♪

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.280
He's always been cold and decisive.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.990
It won't take long for him to get over me.

♪Unforgettable love turned out to be a spell...♪

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.520

Master.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.800
After everything that's happened,

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.110
I find myself no longer concerned

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.680
about her past.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.400
Her true identity

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.400
no longer matters to me.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.200
As long as I know

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.110
she truly cares about me,

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.230
that is enough.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.520
Whatever the future holds,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.750
I trust her.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.040
Your Lordship, though you've refined the netherbeast core successfully,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.560
your body is also weakened by it.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.590
Please take care of yourself.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.350
Don't worry. I know my limits.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.710
Sun Liao,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.560
Jixing Abyss

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.440
had no chance in the first place.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.160
If not for the miasma of the Sunken Abyss

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.750
perfect for breeding netherbeasts,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.950
Father would never have entrusted such an important task

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.110
to Lord Hanfeng.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.560
Now, the netherbeast army is gone,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.520
and my elder brother

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.920
has died so strangely

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.350
in Jixing Abyss.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.520
How am I supposed

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.830
to explain this to Father?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.200
Your Lordship...

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.630
Please,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.350
I beg you to keep this matter secret!

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.470
Look,

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.080
your father has so many sons.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.920
If they all stay alive,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.800
how could he ever value you?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.040
Don't you think so?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.990
In our realm, brothers and friends respect each other.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.920
But lowlifes like you have corrupted

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.990
our relationship.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.750
Anyway, since the netherbeasts have already been refined by Ji Bozai,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.110
it's time for your realm to fall.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.920
Let's start with you.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.800
Your Lordship, spare me!

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.750
Please spare me!

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.710
In fact,

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.860
Lord Hanfeng still has a trick up his sleeve.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.040
He's secretly kept an unformed netherbeast.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.440
Chao Yu hasn't returned to Zhushui for so long,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.160
so Father sent me to check on the situation.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.280
But who would've thought?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.470
Chao Yu actually died.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.750
What is this awful tea?

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.870
Anyway, this is a simple matter.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.830
I can just go back and say

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.560
that to form a netherbeast army,

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.830
my elder brother unexpectedly

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.630
exhausted his spiritual power

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.870
and decided to make the ultimate sacrifice.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.870
Touching, isn't it?

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.440
This will make

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.120
a great story to tell!

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.870
It will also solve a big problem for you.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.750
I appreciate your kindness, Your Lordship,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.990
but I'm afraid I don't understand.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.870
The netherbeasts have been refined by Ji Bozai

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.040
and disappeared from the world.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200
How can we come up

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.830
with a satisfying explanation to your father?

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.110
Even now,

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.560
you are still lying.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.870
Sun Liao already confessed.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.200
Listen carefully.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.160
Hand over the netherbeast you've hidden.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.110
Only then can I cover for you

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.280
in front of Father.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.950
Your Lordship,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.560
you listen carefully.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.350
The beast is in my hands.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.710
If you want my help,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.920
you should say "please."

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.200
"Please"?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.110
You...!

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.110
Do you even know how to use

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.280
what I have?

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.920
If you cooperate with me

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.710
and pin everything

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.990
on that mute corpse,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.920
once my great cause is accomplished,

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.400
everything in Jixing Abyss

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.560
will be credited to you.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.590
Then you'd better hurry.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.350
Father doesn't have my patience.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.680
Where's the "please"?

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.080
Please hurry.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.800
Ming Yi, how are you feeling now?

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.200
I'm fine.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.160
Thank you for your concern, Immortal Situ.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.280
But I'm curious.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.080
How did you know about it so quickly?

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.750
Even Princess Tianji and the others came.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.440
I just regret I couldn't come sooner.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.710
By the barrier,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.750
they found

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.160
a body that couldn't be identified.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.200
The Judgment Hall has examined it,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.520
but we still can't confirm its identity yet.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.630
Was there a wound on the wrist of that body?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.560
I didn't see the person's face,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.590
but I saw a cut

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.110
on his wrist.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.560
Yes, there was indeed.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.160
Right?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.080
But I heard

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.470
the body was burned into a charred skeleton by magic.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.470
Immortal Situ,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.920
how could you tell there was a wound on his wrist?

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.920
Perhaps...

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.950
Ming Yi,

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.080
if I didn't kill him,

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:42.990
he would've killed you.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.520
She cares about me after all.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.040
[Notice: The Soul-hiding Nail law for women has been abolished in Jixing Abyss]

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.630
From now on, women with spiritual veins in Jixing Abyss

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.190
don't need to have Soul-hiding Nails anymore!

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:24.960
That's great!

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.760
Does this mean there will be female warriors?

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.430
The Princess did a great thing!

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.870
Madam, I'll take this one.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.390
All right.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.040
Thank you.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.040
Zhang Tai,

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.040
you were gravely injured.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.800
Are you really okay now?

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.910
Don't worry.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.760
Princess Tianji treated my wounds.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.040
You also had your young friend, Twenty-Seven,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:46.760
send me medicine,

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.720
and I took it.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.240
I've never felt better.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.280
Don't worry about me.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.910
Madam, I'll take this too.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.430
Sure.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:55.630
It was all my fault.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:56.110
Thank you.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.520
If something serious had happened to you,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.390
I really...

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.760
Don't say that.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.720
By the way,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.040
did you notice

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.080
anything different about me today?

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.320
You've applied red blush

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.000
and painted your eyebrows dark green.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:13.960
No, it's not that.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.760
Look, I can use spiritual veins now!

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.110
After I got injured,

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.150
Princess Tianji's people treated me,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.910
and they discovered my Soul-hiding Nail.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.430
They asked if I wanted it removed,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.800
and of course, I said yes.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.830
So now,

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.830
I also have spiritual veins!

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.720
Although I can't break through to a higher stage,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.000
my cultivation has still improved a lot.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.960
In the future, making hairpins

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.430
will be much easier for me.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.800
It must've hurt a lot to remove the nail, right?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.720
At least now

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.560
you can do what you love.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.110
All right, you've seen me.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.280
Now hurry back.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.720
Immortal Ji has been waiting for you for so long.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.870
What's going on between you two?

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.080
Oh, please don't ask.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.320
I don't want to lie to you, but I can't tell you either.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.960
I...

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.630
Actually, I've known for a long time

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.960
that you have many secrets.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.560
I don't want to ask about them,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.150
but I can tell

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.630
Immortal Ji really likes you

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.720
and treats you well.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.000
Of course, that doesn't matter.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.560
What matters is how you feel.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.150
You like him too, don't you?

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480
Yes.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.830
Despite everything, I've fallen for him.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.240
But it won't last.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.590
But Ming Yi,

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.520
you know what?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.040
In this world,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.760
moments of happiness are rare.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.480
You may part ways in the future,

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.480
but you still feel overjoyed

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.150
to see him now, don't you?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.590
Madam,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.910
please wrap this up for me.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.630
Sure.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.760
It seems you're unwilling to do it.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.670
No worries.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.520
I won't force you.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.150
After all, even if you don't do it,

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.590
I have other ways to get it done.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.350
But once it's done,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.150
I will still tell everyone

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.320
that you did it.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.560
You must be joking, Lord Hanfeng.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.320
I am but a humble physician

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.630
with little skill.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.720
If you spread such a story,

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.870
no one will believe it.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.320
How could that be?

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.150
That's exactly what makes it believable.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.670
You, a humble physician

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.870
with little skill, chose to serve me for your own good.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.590
Then one day,

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.480
you made your move against the Emperor

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:47.870
to pledge your loyalty.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.630
Doesn't that sound reasonable?

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.590
Since you'll end up the culprit anyway,

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.830
why not just do it

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.080
and take full credit for it?

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.320
Immortal Yan, the Princess wants to see you.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.830
Immortal Yan, please go over there.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.590
Your Highness.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.000
Your Highness, why have you called for me today?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.150
I'm feeling unwell,

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.240
so I want you to check on me.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.720
You look fine.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.830
How could you be unwell?

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.080
I had a nightmare.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.520
I dreamt that you killed my father,

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.150
and it left me unsettled.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.110
Your pulse is rapid and tense.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.870
I don't think the nightmare caused it.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.040
It's more like you are...

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.670
nervous.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.520
Why would I be nervous?

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.630
I think you are the one who's nervous.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.960
Did Your Highness summon me just to tease me?

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.080
You may leave now.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:27.630
Father!

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.720
Your Highness, give it back to me.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:42.800
What do you mean?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.760
I don't understand.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.150
You can play dumb now,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.910
but I will report to Lord Hanfeng

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.760
and sabotage

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.560
whatever you plan to do.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.800
Then go ahead and tell my uncle.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.150
I will say

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.960
that you gave it to me willingly.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.560
Take a guess.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.830
With you leaving

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.480
my Jade Rabbit Hall at midnight

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.630
and me

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.630
looking so disheveled,

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.280
who will he believe?

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.080
Your Highness,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.390
do you know what you're doing?

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.870
Do you think I'm too afraid to act?

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.910
I just miss my father too much.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.870
What's wrong with that?

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.560
I will return it to you.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.110
No one will know what happened.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.320
Just help me this once.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.910
Just once.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.800
Please, Xiao?

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.670
Why?

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.520
Why are you doing this?

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.910
I trusted you!

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320
You know full well

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.040
that Uncle Qibai caused

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.960
my father's unconsciousness.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.960
He only assigned you to monitor my father's condition

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.000
so you could

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.670
keep him unconscious!

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.280
I know

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.760
most of Jixing Abyss now follows

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.320
Uncle Qibai's orders

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.430
because he can offer them a path to power

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.670
and keep them safe.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.870
But that's their choice.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.080
I don't care about what they choose.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.110
But you can't do this to me.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.190
Why are you doing this?

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.870
You can't do this to me!

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.590
Fine. I'll only ask one thing of you.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.350
Sooner or later, Uncle Qibai

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.000
will take my father's life.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.590
When that day comes,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.430
please help me keep my father alive.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.670
Will you do it for me?

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.520
I'm begging you, Xiao.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.320
Your Highness,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.630
you've overestimated me.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.350
Yes, Lord Hanfeng made me His Majesty's physician,

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.150
but if he wants His Majesty dead,

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.720
what right do I have

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.960
to oppose his will?

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.190
I never thought

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.150
you'd be

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.350
so despicable and shameless,

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.350
only following the wind to gain favor.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.670
You're truly pathetic.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:38.870
I don't know anything.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.680
I never came here.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.540
[Granny's Eatery]

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:28.320
It's ready. It smells great.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.080
Here, Wheat,

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.320
take it to the table over there.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.110
Sir, here's your scallion pancake.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.000
Please enjoy.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.040
He's all you can see, huh?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.720
Madam.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.280
You've grown taller.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.560
Go on. Go back to work.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.630
Since you refined the netherbeast core,

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.560
Mu Qibai has been lying low.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.720
I suspect he's up to something.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.480
Be patient.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:11.720
He's in the shadows,

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.240
but we're not necessarily in the light.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.110
I've had Buxiu keep an eye on Mu Qibai.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.830
We'll find out what he's up to sooner or later.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.630
You said you brought me here to discuss matters,

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.870
but I feel like it's just an excuse.

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.080
Really?

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.480
In fact,

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.390
that night,

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.590
I was under the influence of the Soul-seizing Technique.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.830
That's why I said things I shouldn't have.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.190
Shouldn't we talk about serious matters?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.910
Otherwise, it'll seem like I'm really after something else.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.590
Father, you're awake.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.560
Why have you lost weight?

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.150
In my dreams,

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.960
I kept catching you stealing candy.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:58.800
That's not true.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.790
Lord Ji, you suffered greatly

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:12.960
refining the netherbeast core.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.040
The netherbeasts must have undermined your will, right?

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.590
They had been trying to tempt me

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.310
into accepting their power.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.630
The netherbeasts are indeed tempting.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.560
Whether it's Mu Qibai or the other realms,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.270
none would willingly give up that power.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.590
Without a strong will,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.000
one would surely be corrupted by the netherbeast core.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:47.790
Luckily, it was you.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.150
Luckily, it was me?

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.520
Do you trust me that much?

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.080
Immortal Ji, His Majesty summons you.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.630
You don't seem surprised

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.520
to have been summoned so suddenly.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.480
Of course not.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.590
I've been waiting for this day.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.480
Tianji somehow cured

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.590
the illness that afflicted me.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.230
Her Highness must have sensed the danger

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.400
and feared Your Majesty might be harmed.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.750
Harmed?

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.840
Are you talking about Lord Hanfeng?

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.790
While Your Majesty lay unconscious,

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:02.920
Lord Hanfeng's intentions

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.310
became clear to all.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.520
Your Majesty, you must've heard I refined the netherbeast core

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.080
and sensed Lord Hanfeng's moves.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.710
Do you now see

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.590
how urgent it is

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.710
to root out these hidden dangers?

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.150
I beg you to be resolute.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.310
Bai is my only brother.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.590
Of course I know what he wants.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.590
He's impatient

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.790
and often plots against me.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.840
He even sent a physician to keep watch over me.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.270
I know very well what he's been up to.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.590
But when I remember

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:56.630
how naive and innocent

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.630
this younger brother of mine once was,

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:00.920
I can't bring myself to be harsh.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:02.670
But never...

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.360
never did I expect...

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.960
Never did you expect him to be so driven by greed,

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.000
colluding with Zhushui Spiritual State,

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.520
breeding netherbeasts,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.670
and endangering the Six Realms.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.360
You have done much for Jixing Abyss,

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.040
and I'm deeply grateful.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.520
But the netherbeast army was a direct threat

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.750
to the Six Realms.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.560
Yet you handled it alone and did not report it.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.190
Think of the consequences.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.440
Half of Jixing Abyss follows Lord Hanfeng.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560
Immortal Ji was only trying

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.960
to prevent news from leaking.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.270
Besides,

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.230
it was

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.360
precisely because you once let Uncle Qibai grow strong

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.710
that we are in this crisis now.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.000
Under these circumstances, it was only natural

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.400
that Immortal Ji found Jixing Palace hard to trust.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.880
I swore as a child

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.230
to do everything I could

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.880
to stop Uncle Qibai from harming you again.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.440
Now, no one knows

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.920
what he will do next.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.960
So,

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.790
no matter how reluctant you feel,

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.150
I ask you

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.310
to put Jixing Abyss first

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.110
and seize Uncle Qibai at once.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.190
Immortal Ji, I'd also like to ask you

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.840
to trust us once more

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.110
and join us in protecting Jixing Abyss.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.110
Jixing Palace is indeed hard to trust,

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:26.960
but

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.560
not all who hold power

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.360
are slaves to it.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.230
For the sake of the Six Realms,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.880
I'm willing to unite as many as I can.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.920
But Mu Qibai has Zhushui Spiritual State behind him.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.150
Alone,

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.270
we can

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.790
hardly rival them.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:48.230
Please, Your Majesty, think about the people of Jixing Abyss

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.110
and order Mu Qibai's arrest.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.190
Please, Father, arrest him at once.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.190
Yuanfeng, you haven't fully recovered.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.630
You should be resting.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.480
If there's anything you need,

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.480
just have someone send word for you.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.520
I've been hearing many disturbing rumors lately.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.270
Most of them are about you.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.880
Now that my condition has improved,

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.040
I'd like to hear the truth from you directly.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.270
What rumors?

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.880
I'm being subtle

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.360
because you are my blood brother.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.360
But if you still won't confess to forming a netherbeast army,

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.920
I will have no choice but to take action.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.520
Who made up these rumors?

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.400
They're pure fabrications, nonsense!

00:39:59.110 --> 00:39:59.920
Yuanfeng,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.080
are you going to believe outsiders

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.190
over your own brother?

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:05.110
Qibai,

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:11.520
when did you become like this?

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.360
Like what?

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.310
You've been fragile since childhood.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.270
You used to be gentle and considerate.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.110
When we trained together back then,

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.400
you were so kind.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.590
You'd rather get hurt yourself

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.560
than harm others.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.190
"Rather"?

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.790
"I'd rather"?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
I couldn't, Yuanfeng!

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.360
If I'd been a bit stronger,

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.670
I wouldn't have always been defeated.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.880
If my elder brother had been

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.880
a bit more decisive,

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.880
we wouldn't have been constantly hindered

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.630
by those old fools,

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.040
unable to clean up the rot!

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.840
If you had been

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.310
a bit more resolute,

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.310
Jixing Abyss wouldn't have kept ending up among the Lower Three Realms!

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.040
And even now,

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.880
you, my incompetent brother,

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.790
are still reminiscing

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.880
about my so-called kindness, gentleness, and mercy.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:16.750
You don't deserve to sit in this chair at all!

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.400
Yuanfeng,

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.670
Jixing Abyss won't fall because of the netherbeast army.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.630
It will fall because of people like you.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.270
Chao Yu is dead.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.590
The news of the nameless charred corpse at Dragon Carp Terrace

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.270
has already spread far and wide.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.920
The Emperor of Zhushui will surely investigate thoroughly.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.960
Your Lordship, be careful.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.480
Don't let them find out.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.710
Don't worry.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:11.920
I won't.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.150
To outsiders,

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.190
Mu Qibai is the one who last saw Chao Yu.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.190
He is

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.710
the perfect scapegoat.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.110
Besides, with the netherbeasts refined by Ji Bozai,

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.590
Mu Qibai no longer has value to them.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.310
They won't let him off.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.230
Today, the Emperor of Jixing detained Mu Qibai.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:35.270
Today?

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.270
Yes.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.360
It hasn't been officially announced.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.440
It seems that Ji Bozai

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.790
has gained the upper hand in this game after all.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:49.710
How could it have gone so smoothly?
