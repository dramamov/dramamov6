00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220
Zhou Tingyan, who is that woman?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.380
I saw you smile at her.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.020
She's a client from Qianyi Group.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.620
I can't just keep a straight face
with her.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.740
What do you think of her?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.900
She

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.670
has quite a personality.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.580
(Personality?)

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.780
Zhou Lu said

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.420
it's lunch break now.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.430
Yeah.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.980
Zhou Tingyan,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340
do you like that woman just now?

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.620
She's Qin Zhuo's...

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.180
Zhou Tingyan,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.480
would you divorce me
because of a major client?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.820
Of course not, she's Qin Zhuo's...

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.420
Can I bring you lunch again tomorrow?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.900
Sure.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.420
Then focus on your work.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.340
I stop bothering you.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.260
I wait for you at home.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.780
Yeah.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.500
Jian Cheng.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.460
This is the company.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.300
Have you no shame?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.540
No.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.020
Don't come here again.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.900
Everyone feels awkward when you show up.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.940
Alright then.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.860
I'll bring your wife along next time.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.020
Uncle,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.480
ask Jian Cheng not come
to the company anymore.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.100
When she's here,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.420
we all feel uncomfortable.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.300
You're the one who cheated.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.100
And you're the one with bad character.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.220
So the awkwardness is on you.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.600
I'll have her come to the company
more often.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.500
If you can accept,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.400
then just bear with it.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.110
If you can't,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.660
then keep it to yourself.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.360
So, did you get any answers?

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.380
Zhou Tingyan said he's not going
to divorce me.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.920
From what I can tell,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.220
even if he's a bit curious
about that woman,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.420
it's not much.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.540
That's all?

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.020
Some things are better left

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.100
without digging too deeply.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.750
It's better to let things slide.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.960
Right now,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.710
I try my best to keep him.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.140
If I can,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.360
I'll make a good life with him.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.100
If I can't,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.780
then I'll let him go.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.380
I'm going. See you.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.220
Zhou Lu likes Jian Cheng?

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.740
Since you know it,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.100
why did you ask him for advice?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.420
You're so bad.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.990
Zhou Lu's always had more chances
than me.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.700
But he's overthinking it.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.110
If I had known it
before we got the certificates,

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.740
I might have stepped aside.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.260
They're about the same age.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.880
Zhou Lu's feelings for her
are as strong as mine.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.460
I might have even helped Zhou Lu,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.160
so that he could take good care
of Jian Cheng.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.740
But now, I'm married to Jian Cheng.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.180
It's too late.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.740
The only thing I can do now

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.620
is to act like none of this
ever happened.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.620
From the day Jian Cheng and I
went public,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.740
Zhou Lu has been watching me closely.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.540
He wanted to test my feelings
for Jian Cheng.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.380
And I made my intentions clear to him.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.700
I did it this way,

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.100
to show him I'm committed.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.620
I heard Jian Hongyun asked you
for the Amusement Park Project.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.100
He truly had that idea.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.500
But before that,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.660
I sent Changsheng a huge gift.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.900
Let's see if they can handle it.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.700
What kind of gift?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.100
You'll find out soon.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.620
(Owners complain of leaks
in Shenghui Real Estate's new project)

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.220
To stand up for Jian Cheng,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.890
Zhou Tingyan aims
to bring down the Jian Family.

You better not regret it.

Jian Cheng?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.180

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.380
Yeah.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.740
She went to the company today
to bring lunch to my uncle.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.620
I've got nothing to do at home.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.060
I'll bring you lunch at the company too.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.820
No.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.890
If you go to the company,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.890
it's gonna be awkward for everyone.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.900
Better not go.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.300
I make everyone feel awkward?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.220
What about Jian Cheng?

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.620
She's known you since childhood
for over 20 years,

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.860
got engaged to you, then called it off.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.240
She married your uncle right after.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.060
She goes to the company every day.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.900
Isn't that awkward?

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.820
You don't let me go.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.550
Is it really because of Jian Cheng

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.330
or because you think I'll embarrass you?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.750
You're really sharp-tongued today.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.230
I wasn't planning to quit this early.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.060
I was thinking I'd quit

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.980
after getting pregnant.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.560
Whatever I do at home now,
your mom finds fault.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.980
My mom's not entirely wrong.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.140
It's not like I can't support you.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.900
Why not just relax and be Mrs. Zhou?

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.980
But look at Jian Cheng...

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.820
Enough!

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.500
I'm tired. You get rest early too.

(What's Zhou Tingyan doing?)

(When would my appearance
be the most surprising?)

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.620
I told you not to follow me,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.680
but you insisted on coming.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.620
Why can't I come?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.800
Jian Cheng can be here, but I can't?

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.130
Are you regretting it?

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.620
Stop making a scene.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.180
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I'm not yelling.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.420
Look at your attitude.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.340
Can you even drive?

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.220
Why is it you?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.980
I knew it.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.900
Even parked here, my car still gets hit.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.140
It turns out you.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.220
Yufeng.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.660
What's wrong?

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.100
My stomach hurts badly.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.740
(I'm not losing it yet.)

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.280
(She's trying to play the victim again.)

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.020
My stomach really hurts.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.990
Alright, I'll take you
to the hospital first.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.740
Hello?

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.950
Zhou Tingyan, someone's giving me
a hard time.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.060
Where are you?

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.580
By the roadside near the company.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.090
Zhou Tingyan, my car got hit.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.500
The car is insignificant.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.820
Are you hurt?

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.260
Stay there. I'll be right over.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.260
You don't have to.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.860
I'm not hurt.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.260
I'll be back right away.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.340
Don't worry about me.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.500
Just focus on your work.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.090
Stay right there.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.940
Don't go anywhere.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.380
Alright then.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.660
I'll wait here for you.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.060
Zhou Tingyan.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.330
Didn't you say you weren't hurt?

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.940
See? No bleeding, it's not serious.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.470
What exactly happened?

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.620
It was Zhou Yufeng and Jiang Yawei.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.740
It seems they didn't see it.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.980
They drove straight into my car.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.000
They did it on purpose?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.220
I don't think so.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.660
The pregnant woman's fine physically.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.260
She just needs to rest and recover.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.500
Make sure she isn't stressed again.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.420
Pregnant?

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.980
I'm pregnant?

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.980
Yeah, over two months along.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.980
You need strict bed rest after this.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.500
No more mishaps from now on.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.660
OK, thank you, doctor.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.340
You're going to be a mom,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.260
so you need to think more
about the child.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.780
You can't argue with me
like you did today anymore.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.980
If Jian Cheng's car
hadn't stopped there,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.440
we wouldn't have rear-ended it.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.740
And there'd be no risk to the pregnancy.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.100
Either way,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.900
we finally have a child of our own.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.550
Take good care of yourself.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.900
The baby's so fragile

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.250
and can't take any stress.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.060
I see.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.020
I'll go tell Mom and Dad.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.540
Yeah.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.120
(My mother-in-law's so eager
to have a grandchild.)

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.880
(She'll make sure this baby is safe.)

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.480
- (Just keep Jian Cheng away.)
- Hello?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.220
Dad, Mom,

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.860
Yawei's finally pregnant.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.260
(My good days have finally come.)

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.820
Yeah.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.890
What would you like to eat later?

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.140
I'll ask Mom to bring it over.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.300
Yeah.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.380
(Oh gosh!)

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.670
(They really are everywhere.)

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.620
Jian Cheng,

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.220
I'm pregnant.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.900
It's Yufeng's kid.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.780
No need to deliberately emphasize it.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.900
If it weren't Zhou Yufeng's kid,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.320
then it'd be a real problem.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.260
You're really good at joking.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.380
You should hurry up too.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.980
After all, Uncle Zhou isn't that young
anymore.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.220
He's probably hoping to have a kid soon.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.500
A man hits his prime at 30.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.140
He's still young.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.140
We can do it seven times one night.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.380
How many times for you two?

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.990
Why do you come to the hospital?

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.220
Can't you see?

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.620
So you not only have to pay
for my car repairs,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.120
but also for my medical expenses.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.740
Add me back on WeChat.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.770
Tell me the amount.
I'll transfer it to you.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.620
(Oh, she starts to panic.)

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.700
Alright.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.960
Keep in touch, Yufeng.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.060
