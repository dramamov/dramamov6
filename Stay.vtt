Milestone, you are my moon.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.491
With this ring,

You already know I gotta wake up early.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.602
I gotta open up the gym in the morning.

Tell me why you love this song again.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.615
'Cause the first time I heard it,

01:56.616 --> 01:57.742
I was so struck by it,

01:57.826 --> 02:00.370
I immediately had to figure out
who it was by,

02:00.453 --> 02:02.330
so I could listen to it all the time.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.834
Just like the first time I saw you.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.130
I was so struck by you,
I had to find out who you were,

02:10.839 --> 02:13.925
so I could find a way
to get next to you every single day.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.051

[♪ dramatic music playing]

03:13.318 --> 03:14.903
[Kiara] When I studied in Benin,

03:14.986 --> 03:18.156
I realized the Vodún teachings
my grandmother gave me

03:18.907 --> 03:23.953
connect me to generations of strength,
beauty, love.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.789
I want to help others
change their perspective on Vodún.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.000
Well, then that's what you should write.

03:29.083 --> 03:32.003
Oh, but changing my dissertation course
at this point,

03:32.086 --> 03:33.796
that would set us back so much.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.217
I should just finish it
and get a teaching job.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.677
Nah, that's weak.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.263
You gotta write what you love.

03:43.348 --> 03:47.060
The gym is actually doing really good,
so we don't have to worry about it.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.728

[Kiara giggles]

03:57.320 --> 04:00.365
[Miles] I'ma keep my fade tight
and my body right, and that's it.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.950
[Kiara] That's all you need to do.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.910

I am broken.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.848
I can't be fixed.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.407
The rituals about strength and protection
don't work.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.250
I don't think I'd be able
to carry on without you.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.210
[Miles] I'd better not mess this up,

05:36.294 --> 05:39.881
or you're gonna put a root on me
and stick pins in my voodoo doll.

05:39.964 --> 05:44.510
Keep joking and you might
invite the wrath.

09:59.056 --> 10:02.727
I came out here

And then it wasn't.

But the record player...

10:13.154 --> 10:16.282
The record player was playing on its own.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.965
Maybe it was the vodka
that made you do this dumb-ass shit.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.843
Yeah.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.512
That's what it was, Miles.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.724
It was the vodka.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.811
It was crazy, drunk Kiara,

19:48.729 --> 19:51.815
and her masks and her books
and her spells.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.737
Yeah, that's what it was.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.198
Crazy, drunk Kiara.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.285
Go on, let crazy Kiara...

20:04.578 --> 20:06.079
take care of everything

20:06.163 --> 20:08.081
in a drunken stupor.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.793
Possessed!

20:12.586 --> 20:14.630
And completely out of her mind.

20:16.798 --> 20:17.966
You know what?

20:19.593 --> 20:22.387
This is turning into something
it don't even need to be right now.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.513
Ki...

20:24.223 --> 20:27.434
obviously, you got something you need
to say to me, you want to tell me.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.145
You're going about it the wrong way.
What's up?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.147
No, why don't you use your words, Miles?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.192
All I have done
is talk and talk and tell you,

20:35.275 --> 20:37.486
and try to communicate with you,
but you don't listen.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.570
You never fucking listen!

20:38.654 --> 20:40.113
-You've never listened!
-All I do is listen!

20:40.197 --> 20:41.573
We went to therapy for months,

20:41.657 --> 20:44.117
and I sat there and I listened,
and I listened!

20:44.201 --> 20:46.703
All therapy did was satisfy
your hero complex.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.789
"Hero complex." "Narcissism."

20:48.872 --> 20:52.793
All you did was use therapy to get a bunch
of new words to use against me.

20:52.876 --> 20:55.045
You watched the words come
out of my mouth,

20:55.128 --> 20:57.589
and you refused to hear me!

21:01.218 --> 21:03.637
I tried to help us move forward.
What's so bad about that?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.432
Sorry I couldn't move on.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.645

21:21.154 --> 21:23.115
[Miles] I can't believe
you even said that.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.743
You have no idea how hard it was
for me to leave.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.247
Oh, really?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.666
But you still left, Miles.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.044
And now you can pity me from afar
and say you didn't crumble.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.504
You wear it like a fucking badge!

21:38.171 --> 21:39.798
-I ain't even--
-What?

21:39.881 --> 21:41.049
What?

21:42.092 --> 21:43.093
Now you feel guilty?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.012
[Kiara scoffs]

21:47.264 --> 21:50.851
I was willing to forgive you,
but you let him come between us.

49:51.321 --> 49:52.781
There's my mom's handwriting.

49:53.865 --> 49:56.326
Looks like she was trying
to translate some notes.

49:57.369 --> 49:59.663
[sighs] She used to do these meditations.

49:59.746 --> 50:02.332
-Like rituals?
-Yeah, like healing rituals.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.584
But I was so young when she died, I...

50:06.003 --> 50:07.421
never really held on to it.

50:09.589 --> 50:10.590

50:12.300 --> 50:14.219
[softly] She was a great teacher.

50:15.053 --> 50:16.763
Yeah, I wish I could have met her.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.181
She would've loved you.

50:19.891 --> 50:22.728
I tried to conjure her spirit once,
when I was 16.

50:24.479 --> 50:25.897
I wasn't powerful enough.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.610
Did you ever try
to conjure another spirit?

50:37.284 --> 50:38.285
No.

I was gonna give this away.

51:19.701 --> 51:23.288
The notes say millet flour...

51:27.250 --> 51:28.460
and something personal,

51:28.543 --> 51:30.629

my mom gave me...

[turns tap water on]

51:46.478 --> 51:48.146
I found our old love letters.

Oh, no. How corny were they?

51:50.148 --> 51:51.316
[chuckles softly]

51:52.359 --> 51:54.611
-They were really sweet.
-So, super corny?

51:54.694 --> 51:55.946
[laughs]

51:58.031 --> 52:00.117
They reminded me of how we used to be.

-Yeah.

52:55.338 --> 52:57.007
I know you don't like it,

52:57.090 --> 53:01.803
but the notes say
we need to stay open and receive.

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.886
-Roger that.
-[Kiara] But if you're gonna fly as fast

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.765
as a Bell P-39 Airacobra,
you might need this.

01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:19.517
-Another one?!
-[Kiara laughs]

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.727
Oh, another one before it was time
to open up the gifts?

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:24.355
[Kiara] Come on.
Birthdays only come once a year.

01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:25.481
[both laugh]

01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:27.483
-[shutter clicks]
-[Jeremiah] Ooh, how does it look, Mama?

01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:29.860
[Kiara] The most handsome
little pilot I ever saw.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:31.404
-[Jeremiah giggles]
-[Kiara] Oh!

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.822
What time is it? I gotta...

01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:34.532
-[mouthing] It's time to go.
-Oh, wait. Hold on.

01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:35.783
[mimics radio crackling]

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:38.285
-This is air traffic control. Go for me.
-What's happening?

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:40.788
Oh, unfortunately,
I have to make another pit stop.

01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:42.665
Gotta pick up a few things.

01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:45.084
But fly safe in my absence, please.
Do you copy?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.086
-[mimics radio crackling]
-Good gracious!

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.255
-[Miles chuckles]
-Thank you for enjoying our party anyway.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.881
[Miles] Fly safe. I'll be right back.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:52.174
Mwah.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.592
Okay, bye.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.512
Okay, Lieutenant,
we gotta get you dressed.

01:06:56.595 --> 01:06:58.389
You gotta be fresh for your birthday!

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:01.267
[Jeremiah] Oops, forgot Fren.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:03.477

Excuse me, First Lieutenant.
No flying in the house.

-Aw, Mom, please?
-I'm serious, baby. Mwah.

-Hi, Sabrina.
-[Sabrina] [on phone] Hi, Kiara.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.249
How's it going?

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.168
[Sabrina] Have you thought
about your next book?

01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:29.170
Oh, my God, yes! I--

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:30.963
- [Sabrina] Really?
-Absolutely.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.883
-[toy plane buzzing]
-I... I have so many ideas

01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:37.219
about how to expand
the world and the characters.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:39.889
[Sabrina] Great, because the publisher
wants to put you on a book tour.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:41.223
Mommy, I almost did it!

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.435
Jeremiah, I'm on a call.
I said no flying in the house.

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:47.646
Go out front, and I'll watch you
from the window, okay?

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.731
Okay.

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.275
[Kiara] I love you.

01:07:51.358 --> 01:07:52.735
Yeah, sorry. He's just--

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:55.237
He's really excited about his gift.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.406
Ah, yes! Monday's great.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.075
I would love that.

01:08:12.379 --> 01:08:14.298
Ah! Oh, my God, Sabrina!

01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:16.217
-The New York Times?
-[Sabrina] Mm-hmm.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.177
-They actually said that?
-[Sabrina] Verbatim.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.304
-[toy plane buzzing]
-Oh, my God. [chuckles]

01:08:20.387 --> 01:08:21.388
Yes.

01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:23.182

-Yes. Absolutely.

Okay. When? Yeah.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.606
This is First Lieutenant Jeremiah
and Second Lieutenant Fren

Oh, no.

-[♪ tender music fades out]

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:43.369
[Sabrina] Kiara, The New York Times
is calling you "the voice of the future."

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:46.372
Thank you so much
for believing in me, Sabrina.

[water lapping]

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:55.172
Yeah, I'm gonna get back
to cooking for this little man's party.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.257
[Sabrina] Of course.

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.178
Okay, talk soon.

01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:30.916
What's wrong?

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:34.086
Sabrina just called and...

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.548
said she just booked me a book tour!

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.633
-[laughing]
-That's amazing!

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.720
Well, let's get the party started, then.

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:44.054
-Yes.
-Where's J?

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:45.347
He's out front.

No, he's not.

-You didn't see him?
-No.

01:09:49.643 --> 01:09:51.228
[Kiara] Jeremiah!

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.563
[Miles] Buddy!

[softly] God!

01:09:59.236 --> 01:10:00.487
He's not out there.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.199
[Kiara] Where is this boy?

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:05.492
Probably hiding again. Jeremiah!

01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:07.786
Jeremiah, come on. It's party time!

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:13.584
Jeremiah?

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.045
[Miles] J!

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.590
If you want birthday cake,
you gotta come out!

[Kiara] J?

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:26.430
Okay, come out, baby.
You know I don't like it when you do this.

01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:28.557
Jeremiah!

Here, take him, take him.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.626
[Kiara] Come on, baby. No! No.

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:57.002
Call 911!

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.129
Baby. Call 911!

01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:00.881
-No! [crying]
-Is he breathing?

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:02.591
Yeah, so we just pulled my son
out of the pool.

[sobbing and exhaling]

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:05.719
Ki, is he breathing yet? Keep pumping!

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.179
-Keep pumping his chest!
-Oh, God!

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.889
-[sobbing]
-I need you to get here right now, please!

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:09.974
J, can you hear me?

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.642
-Breathe, buddy. Breathe.
-Come on, baby!

01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:13.686

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:15.229
Let me try. Jeremiah.

01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:17.314
It's okay. No, it's okay.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.441
-Okay...
-[Miles grunting]

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.443
What do I do? What did I do?

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.028
Somebody help us!

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.489
[sobbing] Oh, no!

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:27.032
J! Breathe!

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.284
[Kiara wailing]

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.035
Come on, breathe, buddy. Breathe!

01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:32.329
[panting] J!

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:35.040
[screaming] No! No!

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.127
No, no, no!

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.670
[sobbing] No!

01:11:39.753 --> 01:11:41.297
[panting and grunting]

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.798
We can't wait. We can't wait.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.259
Come on, we can't wait. Let's go!

01:11:45.342 --> 01:11:47.303
Let's go. Let's go.

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:49.221
[♪ somber music playing]

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:04.653
[softly] It's all my fault.

01:12:08.073 --> 01:12:09.491
[Miles] Don't say that.

01:12:13.787 --> 01:12:16.957
I stopped watching him for 60 seconds...

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.087
and he was gone.

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.302
I'll never hear him say,

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:30.095
"I love you, Mommy."

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.474
I'll never kiss his forehead again.

01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:35.684
[crying] I'll never kiss his cheek.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:38.896
[Kiara sniffles]

01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:42.733
I'm not a mother anymore. [exhales]

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.488
You'll always be his mother.

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:51.116
Just like I'll always be his father,
no matter what.

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.167
[breathing shakily]

01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:04.838
I couldn't bring myself
to say this to anybody...

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.928
but after the accident, I, um...

01:13:11.011 --> 01:13:12.179
[clears throat]

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.723
...I kept having this dream

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:18.310
about Jeremiah and, um...

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:22.022
In the dream, he was in the pool.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:26.026
But he was, like... he was happy.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:30.114
He was laughing, he was smiling.
He was all...

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:33.367
He was asking me
all kind of random questions,

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:36.829
insisting I call him First Lieutenant.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.460
[softly] He's so beautiful in the dream.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.883
He's perfect in the dream. Perfect.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.929
[normal] And then I'd, um...

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.268
I wake up and I'm in cold sweats.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:04.440
So, it just got to the point
where, like...

01:14:05.732 --> 01:14:07.526
[exhales sharply]

01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:16.827
...I was scared to go to sleep

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:19.121
because...

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.127
I'd wake up and he'd still be...

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:29.548
So, it was almost worse,
like seeing him all the time,

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.383
and then waking up, and he's not...

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:33.552
He's not...

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:37.598
[inhales deeply]

01:14:37.681 --> 01:14:39.057
[exhales] But then...

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.146
I was losing you at the same time.

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.027
So, when you called me a coward,
you were right.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:51.695
Because...

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:57.701
I was scared that I was gonna break.

01:14:58.744 --> 01:14:59.870
And just...

01:14:59.953 --> 01:15:01.538
I didn't know how to handle it.

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:04.166
I didn't know what to do,
so I said I was moving forward.

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:05.751
But really, I was just scared.

01:15:07.544 --> 01:15:10.172
[breathing shakily]

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.176
I didn't know you were hurting so much.

01:15:18.096 --> 01:15:20.557
I was so wrapped up in my own pain.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.605
[sighs]

01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:30.234
[sighs] I'm so tired.

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:33.904
I'm so tired, Miles.

01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:35.155
[sniffles]

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:39.243
[sighs] I know you are, too.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.995
I'm exhausted, Ki.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.081
[snorts]

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:47.626
Absolutely exhausted.

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:55.592
You're the smart one, but I know
we gotta find a way to get past this.
