ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.131
What do you want?

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:52.635
To go back…

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.473
to the time
before you came up with the special act.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.932
You'll stop me until the end?

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.601
You did the best you could.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:00.977
So,

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.313
stop here.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.564
Is that what you want?

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:09.569
You even dug up your painful memories
that have tormented you

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:14.157
and got a fake illegitimate child,
because you want me to stop?

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:20.830
Answer me.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.582
Yes.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.169
I want us to go back,
like nothing has happened.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.963
Because nothing

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.965
has happened.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.426
Even if I give up on the special act,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:37.847
we can't go back.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.100
"As if nothing happened"?

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.520
"Nothing has happened"?

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.441
What you said here today
will come back to haunt you.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.692
I don't care.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.988
As long as I can stop the special act.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.160
What on earth are you hiding?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.999
What is it that scares you
even more than an illegitimate child?

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.629
LEE HWA-JIN

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.318
Why did you have to go that far?

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.906
I know you made Park Seo-a
spread the video

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:39.659
Ko A-ram backed up to the cloud.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.746
I've been thinking about it,

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.125
and it's just too much.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.215
So you weren't just handling
the divorce case.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.512
I wondered how the victims' statements
and the lawsuit

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.890
were moving so unusually fast.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.057
It was you.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.810
You won't be able
to escape punishment either,

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.438
for instigating those kids.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:12.692
I don't intend to.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.446
I did something wrong,

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.281
so I deserve to be punished.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.583
I don't understand why you're doing this.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.379
Didn't you join Hyun's campaign
because your husband was unfairly blamed

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.173
and denied worker's compensation?

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.093
Didn't you enter politics
to make things right?

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.054
I don't understand how someone like that

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.890
could commit a crime
using the president-elect as an excuse.

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:50.188
You know more about me than I thought.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.191
Most lawyers get others
to do the background checks,

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.901
but I do it myself.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.445
Just like I did
with Ko A-ram and Park Seo-a.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.949
It wasn't for the president-elect.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.326
It it were,

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:07.747
I wouldn't have pushed
his only daughter that far.

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.708
Then who was it for? What was it for?

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.628
"Punishment is not what we want."

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.296
"We want our family back."

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.259
"Revenge is not what I want."

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.887
"I want my mom and dad to come back home."

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.850
This was your eulogy for your parents
after losing them

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.019
to the H Chemical fire in 2012.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.654
You did your research.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.616
Why did you take the divorce case?

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.536
Why did you decide
to be on Ms. Cha's side?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.373
What do you want?

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.962
I'm not obligated to answer that.

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.547
I want the truth.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.634
And I want the truth
to punish those who did wrong.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.761
So the victims
don't turn into perpetrators

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:10.351
Just like the man who got framed
for arson after an unjust death,

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.811
Do Tae-hun.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.694
If you're on Ms. Cha's side for revenge,

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.322
remember this.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.158
Ms. Cha must already know that.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.453
She gave you the case

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.414
to use your resentment
towards the president-elect.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.623
I don't care.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:37.211
Because after getting revenge on him,

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.588
your next target is

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.089
Ms. Cha?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.594
Or are you planning to come between them

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.096
so the divorce suit ruins them both?

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.688
Ms. Cha uses people.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.648
She doesn't get used.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.068
Let me ask you again.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.070
What do you want?

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.539
It's been about ten minutes.
My client's waiting.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.042
We might want the same thing.

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:19.378
If you really want revenge…

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.758
If you really want a just punishment,

00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:25.218
the answer is

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.179
the special act, not the divorce suit.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.515
-Once the special act is passed--
-Hey, look.

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:34.727
You don't know how awful hope is, do you?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.355
I've tried literally everything
for the past 15 years.

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:40.358
I've protested, collected signatures
on the streets,

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.985
everything I could
to get the special act passed.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.987
I was so desperate…

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.370
that I even became a lawyer.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.378
There's this thing Ms. Cha has.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.506
We can get the special act passed

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.424
if you help me get it.

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.009
A thing?

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.427
Something that keeps

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.763
the Party for Peace and Freedom
under control.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:15.101
Something like an audio tape
or an accounting ledger.

00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:16.811
-If you just--
-Steal it?

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:20.898
You said you tried everything.

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:25.403
So why not try

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.698
one more thing?

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.625
Are you defying me?

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.545
Release U-yeong first.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:43.963
After that.

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.049
So you don't trust me.

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:56.684
I've never had a dad.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.607
So I want to make sure
our child has a dad.

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:04.442
"Our child"?

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.069
You told me not to make it anxious.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:10.990
It was thanks to you.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.242
If I hadn't met you,

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.620
my life would've been so boring.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.842
The guy who got arrested

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:30.927
is the father?

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.012
Release U-yeong first.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:35.306
Then I'll do whatever you say.

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:37.016
What if I release him

00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:39.894
and you still don't do as I say?

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.775
I haven't thought about it.

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:51.322
So you don't trust me either.

00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:08.631
LAWYER KANG SEON-HO

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:13.844
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.846
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.557
Additional charges may apply.

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:19.976
It's me, Cha Su-yeon.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.938
You must be being questioned right now.
Come to my place as soon as you hear this.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.900
I need to have her sign a paper
agreeing to do as I say

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.278
in exchange
for releasing the child's father.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:35.533
A legally binding document drafted
in the presence of a lawyer.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.749
Once I sign the paper,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.501
will you release U-yeong?

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.420
If we can't trust each other,

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.214
we have to rely on the law.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:51.924
We're good now?

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:05.104
The Special Act for
the Investigation of the H Chemical Fire

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:07.315
and the Establishment of a Safer Society,

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.193
also known as the Do Tae-hun Special Act,
the vote on it is just a day away.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.071
The Party for Peace and Freedom
has officially opposed the bill,

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.949
breaking from
former Assemblywoman Bae's earlier pledge.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.536
Let's hear from Noh Cheol-jae,
the floor leader of the party.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.788
We've never changed our party's stance.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:28.419
We just corrected the improper deal
former Assemblywoman Bae made

00:10:28.502 --> 00:10:30.504
in return for the prime minister position.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:33.424
It hasn't been long
since the election ended.

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:37.261
What we need to do now is
unite the divided people,

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:41.515
not divide the nation
by bringing up the special act

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.267
and playing the blame game.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.853
Tell me, how does that serve
our national interest?

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.315
Will your party officially
oppose the special act?

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.734
Well…

00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:56.280
We've got to do what we've got to do.

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.407
Although,

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.952
there will be another meeting
before tomorrow's vote.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.245
That's it for today.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.206
-Sir.
-A quick word, please.

00:11:05.289 --> 00:11:07.333
There is growing attention on whether

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.628
the president-elect's
first campaign pledge will fall through.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.675
You did the best you could.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.094
So,

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:20.679
stop here.

00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:25.893
Ms. Cha left.

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.019
But…

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.857
He's stuck in there for hours.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.031
Secretary Shin.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.123
You can't just barge in here.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.542
Don't tell him about our call.

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.211
Once he finds out, I'll be fired.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.342
This is Shin Hae-rin.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.886
I have something urgent to tell you.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.310
I'm coming in.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:29.915
I heard that Chief Secretary Lim
proposed passing the special act.

00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:33.461
You're not supposed to know that.

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.546
I heard it from Chief Secretary Lim.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.006
What else did he say?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.508
That you didn't accept the offer.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.719
Was that the urgent thing
you wanted to talk about?

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:44.013
You wanted to ask me
why I didn't accept it?

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:45.097
No.

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:47.766
I will get the special act passed.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.480
I'm not asking for help.

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.231
I'm asking you to stay out of it.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.149
Secretary Shin.

00:12:55.232 --> 00:12:57.860
Please don't forget
why you started the divorce suit.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.196
It was for the special act.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.530
Not for Ms. Cha.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:05.034
I thought it was President Yu
who was trying to stop it.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.162
So I was trying to protect her from him.

00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:09.663
Now you know.

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:13.417
Now you know that Ms. Cha is the one
who has been stopping it!

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:17.463
I need to check something first.

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:18.506
After that--

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:21.008
The one trying to stop the investigation
must be behind the incident.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.052
Secretary Shin.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.596
If Ms. Cha, who was trying to stop
the special act, is the culprit,

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.597
she must pay for it.

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:29.934
Only then can we prove
Do Tae-hun's innocence.

00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:33.562
You know

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.274
politics isn't that simple.

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:38.359
I know.

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:42.780
I also know you've never turned away
from a problem with such an excuse.

00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:46.158
Are you saying I have changed?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.664
Maybe you have changed.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.918
Please don't stop the special act
just to protect Ms. Cha.

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.712
And please don't stop me.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:10.975
I can bear everything else.

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:15.271
But the 20 years that I have lived for you

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.065
going to waste…

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.609
I can't bear that.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.538
My wife wants me
to give up on the special act.

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:36.125
She said if I keep pushing it,

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.752
she'd expose who I had an affair with.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.297
Lee Hwa-jin?

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.176
Did you know?

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.638
I did get a feeling
that she was getting the wrong idea.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.849
But it's not true.

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:54.059
She says it doesn't matter if it's true

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:57.021
because Lee Hwa-jin will speak
to the press herself.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.817
She's going that far?

00:15:07.197 --> 00:15:08.532
You're right.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.202
I've never avoided anything
because politics is complicated.

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:15.247
But the problem I'm facing now
is extra complicated.

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.207
So give me some time.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.920
Time to solve this problem.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.590
We don't have time.

00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:26.216
We do, until the inauguration.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.259
No.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.512
I'm not talking about your time.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.391
I'm talking about the time I have left.

00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:40.022
I made myself clear.

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:42.816
Don't stop the special act.

00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:06.590
SPECIAL ACT

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:16.976
Secretary Shin!

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:19.645
You think I'd just walk away quietly?

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:23.816
One word from me,
and you're done for, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:27.403
Just imagine how many secrets
I know about you from the past 20 years.

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:30.280
And imagine what will happen
once I disclose them.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.865
You have no idea!

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.867
Have you lost your mind?

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.328
You think you can just throw me out
and get away with it?

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:37.913
Calm down. Let's talk outside.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.165
-Let go!
-Let's talk outside.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.085
-Let go.
-Come on. Talk with me.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.108
Breaking news. Civil war has broken out.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.110
Secretary Shin attacked
the president-elect.

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:10.863
She was cussing and yelling.
It was no joke.

00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.657
She was the top contributor.
I'm not surprised.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.410
PARTICIPATION NATIONAL PARTY

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:20.497
The alliance of parties other than
the Party for Peace and Freedom

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:21.874
is already falling apart.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:28.422
No wonder. The divorce and the affair
ruined the president-elect's credibility.

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:32.885
Some are already calling for
the president-elect to leave the party.

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:35.721
If we push the special act too hard
and it fails,

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:37.347
we'll take the blow too--

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.475
Mr. Kwon, let's take a short recess.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.228
What is this?

00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:49.485
Sir, what are they saying? Secretary Shin
lashed out at the president-elect?

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:50.861
The vote is tomorrow!

00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:54.782
We're at war now. We can't afford
a civil war on top of that.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:56.825
Goodness!

00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.204
She's been the president-elect's
closest aide for the past 20 years.

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:03.415
She deserves to be honored
for her contribution, not fired.

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.709
This isn't just about the president-elect!

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:09.213
She's seen and heard everything
within our party about the election!

00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:11.423
What if she points the gun at us?

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.844
Let's hear what she wants.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.014
We have to ease her anger somehow.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.685
Geez, what on earth…

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.114
Hello? Assemblyman Choi?

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.367
Hello, Secretary Shin. It's me.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.910
So…

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.287
I heard something upsetting happened.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.790
Upsetting?

00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:47.334
It's not a personal matter like that.

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:52.047
The party won't crumble just because
a low-ranking member like me leaves.

00:18:52.714 --> 00:18:54.967
But if the special act gets thrown out,

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.178
our party's identity could be at stake.

00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:01.557
I just raised my voice a bit,
trying to be forthright with him.

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.185
I know. I know how loyal you are.

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.355
I understand. I do.

00:19:08.438 --> 00:19:09.690
Speaking of which,

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:13.944
it seems like the Party for Peace
and Freedom will turn in favor of the act.

00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:18.866
As long as we keep our stance,
we'll easily get it passed.

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.204
You must really like jjamppong.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.165
You never go to barbecue restaurants.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:31.003
I thought you knew that
I stopped going since the fire incident.

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:32.754
Right.

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:34.381
Sorry.

00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:36.383
I forgot. Goodness.

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:38.218
Jjamppong is my comfort food.

00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:41.388
I don't need to worry
about who grills the meat.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.391
You do that every once in a while.

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:46.977
What about the source

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.063
Cha Su-yeon promised to give us?

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.481
No news.

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.402
But no news is good news, you know.

00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:59.406
To catch a big fish like this,

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.034
I need to be patient and wait.

00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:03.243
That's true.

00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:05.996
Right.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:08.207
You heard
about the new program launch, right?

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.336
Looks like they're pushing it
as the main show.

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:13.879
I saw the budget and…

00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:15.797
Man, it was a lot.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:20.427
Speaking of which…

00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:28.268
What? Just say it.

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:33.148
You're on the shortlist for the host.

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.403
Well, of course,

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:41.240
there are candidates from outside,
and even other networks,

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:42.950
so it'll be tough competition.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.204
But I'm betting on you.

00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:51.416
But don't go alone, okay?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.210
We've been working as a team.

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.587
Better the devil you know.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:56.838
Why?

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.967
Is being the team leader
for News Magazine not enough?

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.093
Come on.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:04.012
News Magazine is not my program.
It's yours.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.598
And no one can replace you.

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:07.766
So if you're going,

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:09.977
take me with you.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:13.939
Why me, though?

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:19.319
With your people skills, convincing people
from outside or other networks

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.113
would be a piece of cake.

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:24.616
I'm a loyal person.

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.119
What is this really about?

00:21:28.912 --> 00:21:30.956
We hit a homer
with Cha's wiretapping story.

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:34.001
Let's go for a back-to-back homer
with the president-elect's affair.

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.544
Then the game's over.

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:38.755
Whoever's in the shortlist,
they won't be able to beat you.

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:43.051
Counting the chickens before they hatch,

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.095
I'm already getting full.

00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:46.888
Oh, come on.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.432
That's not what it is.

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:52.227
The universe is sending
good energy your way.

00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:55.314
You know how intuitive I am.

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.238
Oh, boy.

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:06.908
Look who's calling.
Secretary Shin with no connections.

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:08.785
SHIN HAE-RIN

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:10.912
Sure.

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.206
Hello?

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.542
I was going to call you.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:17.836
I heard you quit.

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.254
What happened?

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:25.469
Right, that wasn't so nice of me then.
I didn't answer your calls.

00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:30.640
You know presidential candidates
declare their assets.

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:32.809
Who doesn't know that?

00:22:33.393 --> 00:22:36.188
What? Will you report him
for breaking the election law?

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:39.983
And if declared jewelry gets stolen,

00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:41.485
it's a criminal case, right?

00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:42.611
Yes, it is.

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:46.490
A simple theft. Nothing more than
a single line in the news. Why do you ask?

00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:50.786
What if it's undeclared jewelry
that gets stolen?

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:54.831
That can be a little bigger case.

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:59.377
What if the undeclared jewelry
gets stolen,

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:03.340
and you collude with the thief
to blackmail the president-elect?

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.217
Wow.

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:09.096
Just hearing that excites me.

00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:11.264
Are you sure, though?

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:14.184
Look into Seon U-yeong
arrested at Haseong Police Station.

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:16.812
Haseong Police Station. Seon U-yeong.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:20.398
Are you sure about this?
I need to know for sure before I dive in.

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:22.901
Kang Seon-ho is Seon U-yeong's lawyer.

00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:24.402
Cha Su-yeon's divorce lawyer?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.991
Does this mean
Cha has Seon U-yeong's back?

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:31.618
No.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.248
She's using Seon U-yeong to join forces
with Lee Hwa-jin, her stylist.

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.375
Her and Seon U-yeong are close.

00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:42.087
All right. Let me process this.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.630
That's all I can give you.

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:52.556
Cheon is right
about the universe sending energy.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.683
This is my ticket to the new program.

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.226
MBS REPORTER KIM YUN-JI

00:23:58.436 --> 00:23:59.563
Hi, Min-ju.

00:23:59.646 --> 00:24:02.399
See if there's a Seon U-yeong arrested
at Haseong Station.

00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:05.652
And write down everything that you hear.
I'll be right there.

00:24:05.735 --> 00:24:06.611
Hey!

00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:12.784
To MBS, please.

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:25.547
That kind of paper has no legal power.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.383
If you get Seon U-yeong released,

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:33.180
Lee Hwa-jin does anything you say?
What is this, a gift voucher?

00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:35.348
Just make it believable to her.

00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:36.766
That's what matters.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.644
I'll keep the promise anyway.

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:46.067
Are you telling me to trick Lee Hwa-jin?

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:48.069
It may look like tricking her,

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:50.697
but the results will be the same.

00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:54.701
Seon U-yeong will be released,
and the divorce case will be dropped.

00:24:58.872 --> 00:25:02.000
A petition is enough
to release Seon U-yeong.

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.295
You didn't really

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.048
listen to what I said.

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:12.344
Stopping the divorce suit is the priority.

00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:15.096
Petition or whatever comes next.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.432
The detention period will expire soon.

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:19.017
Before the arrest warrant--

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.770
Whether he's arrested or ends up in jail,

00:25:22.395 --> 00:25:23.521
I don't care.

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.816
Mr. Kang.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.361
Don't forget who you're working for.

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:33.323
Until the divorce case is dropped,

00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:35.992
there will be no petition or release.

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:39.204
Did the president-elect say
he'd withdraw the divorce suit?

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.747
It's a matter of time.

00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:42.999
Just make sure

00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:45.502
that she can rest assured.

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.382
Yes, ma'am.

00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.468
I'll get going now.

00:25:57.514 --> 00:26:00.392
By the way, I didn't get to eat today.

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:04.396
Before I go, can I have ramyeon
down in the kitchen?

00:26:06.314 --> 00:26:08.024
Ramyeon won't do.

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:11.027
I'll have my butler prepare a meal.

00:26:13.863 --> 00:26:14.948
Hello?

00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:17.575
Could you prepare a meal for Lawyer Kang?

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:20.704
And more tea for me.

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.789
I want to get more rest.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.041
Thanks.

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:28.878
Anything more you want to say?

00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:30.213
No.

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.091
I'll go downstairs, then.

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:22.390
Let me know if you want more.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.476
Actually,

00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:27.937
I was just about to ask
for one more bowl of rice.

00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:30.982
My gosh, you must've been famished.

00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:33.193
That's three bowls of rice.

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.821
Well, I had a lot of things

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.449
to deal with today.

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:52.253
Do you not

00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:54.506
have a family?

00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:59.010
You're always here, you never go home.

00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:01.638
I've been doing this since I was 16.

00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:04.349
I never had time to make a family.

00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:09.479
But then,

00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:13.858
you've been with Ms. Cha for a long time.
She must be like family to you.

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:16.945
Family? No way.

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:20.073
She was the first person
to ever treat me like a human.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.620
I used to be called a servant,

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:28.623
but she gave me the title of butler.

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.170
I didn't know
you were such a sociable person.

00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:36.965
Oh, I apologize.

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.174
I went overboard.

00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:40.677
No, I like it. It feels natural.

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.430
You don't have to stand there.

00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.683
Please do your thing.
I'll clean up after finishing it.

00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:49.018
No, you can just leave it there.

00:28:50.019 --> 00:28:52.272
I'll go check on Ms. Cha.

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:54.816
I just made some more tea for her.

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:55.817
Okay.

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.249
No legal power?

00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:14.919
That's why I came here
before going to Ms. Cha's place.

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:16.880
I thought you should know.

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.718
So she lied to me.

00:29:22.302 --> 00:29:23.678
But

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:26.264
there's another way
to get U-yeong released.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:30.477
Please tell me in detail
where and how you stole the necklace.

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:35.648
Why do you ask that?

00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:39.194
I'm going to find Ms. Cha's weakness.

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:40.403
Once I find it,

00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:42.655
I can

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:44.949
help get U-yeong released.

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:48.995
Trust me.

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:51.623
I will get him out.

00:29:58.254 --> 00:30:00.381
I stole the necklace

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:02.217
from the walk-in closet.

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.422
Was it in a safe?

00:31:23.006 --> 00:31:26.259
No. It was in a display cabinet,
not a safe.

00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:29.220
I frequented the place,
so I knew where it was.

00:31:35.768 --> 00:31:37.061
Gosh, that scared me.

00:31:52.035 --> 00:31:54.996
And the cabinet isn't locked?

00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:56.623
It isn't.

00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:59.000
What about a safe? Was there no safe?

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:03.963
Oh, I've seen it.

00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.757
A safe, in the dressing room.

00:32:06.966 --> 00:32:09.761
When I took out the necklace
from the cabinet,

00:32:09.844 --> 00:32:12.096
I saw a button under the shelf.

00:32:19.228 --> 00:32:21.731
When I pressed the button,
the wall slid open.

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:36.996
Please enter your password.

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:43.586
I need to know the password.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.923
Most of Ms. Cha's passwords,
including her phone,

00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:48.800
are 1119.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:51.177
Ji-yu's birthday.

00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:04.315
Wrong password.

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.650
Please try again.

00:33:13.866 --> 00:33:16.411
Wrong password.

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:17.537
Please try again.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.707
After three failed attempts,
you cannot re-enter for an hour.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.085
One hour?
It's over if it gets locked for an hour.

00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:41.310
Is it six digits, not four?

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.397
My electronic door lock is six digits too.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.654
Except for one and nine…

00:33:53.948 --> 00:33:54.949
Zero.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.451
Zero.

00:33:56.951 --> 00:33:57.994
Zero.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.872
I just need to combine them.

00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:04.083
Most of Ms. Cha's passwords,
including her phone,

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.752
are 1119.

00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:07.336
Ji-yu's birthday.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.255
It's Ji-yu's birthday.

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:13.259
Ji-yu is a freshman in high school,
so she's 17.

00:34:13.342 --> 00:34:16.179
I'm 29, so she's 12 years younger than me.
That means

00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:18.181
she was born in 2010.

00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:22.143
If it's six digit…

00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:26.272
1011…

00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:29.233
Nineteen.

00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:49.378
Safe unlocked.

00:34:49.462 --> 00:34:51.422
The door is opening.

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:53.025
What were you doing in there?

00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:54.735
Shush. I…

00:35:56.654 --> 00:36:00.616
I took a selfie
to post on my social media.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.536
Don't tell your mom about this.

00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:07.498
Right, and I followed your account.
Make sure you follow me back.

00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:13.629
Ko A-ram and Park Seo-a
didn't contact you, did they?

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.009
No.

00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:20.970
They haven't since they were disciplined.

00:36:21.971 --> 00:36:25.600
As I said before, if they come
find you or anything, let me know.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:28.019
I'll deal with them right away, okay?

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.271
Lawyer Kang.

00:36:32.648 --> 00:36:34.859
Why did you come back up?

00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:40.698
Well, I wanted to thank you for the dinner
you prepared for me.

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:44.202
I ate to my heart's content.
Thank you so much.

00:36:46.662 --> 00:36:48.122
Well, then.

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.416
I should really get going.

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:07.350
KANG SEON-HO
LAWYER

00:37:07.433 --> 00:37:09.477
REVEALING THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE

00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:18.319
He's such an attention seeker.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.071
You must be tired.

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:24.075
I lost my touch from the few days' rest.

00:37:24.158 --> 00:37:26.577
Since I wasn't making progress,
it was even harder.

00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:29.789
You should eat.
Wash first. I'll prepare food for you.

00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:32.708
I just need something

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:34.585
to drink.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.001
You said you could pass the special act
if you had this. Are you sure?

00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:16.877
Where are you?

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:18.546
I'll go to you.

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:22.758
I just left the house.

00:38:22.842 --> 00:38:24.427
There's a secondhand bookstore

00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:27.471
ten minutes from here
that I like to visit.

00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:28.973
A secondhand bookstore?

00:38:30.933 --> 00:38:33.394
Lawyer Kang, can you hear me?

00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:35.688
I don't know

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:37.857
if I should

00:38:38.357 --> 00:38:39.734
trust you,

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.153
Secretary Shin.

00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:45.573
Why would you say that?

00:38:46.198 --> 00:38:48.409
"We can pass the special act with this."

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:52.038
There were way too many people
who took advantage of us in the past.

00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:55.333
If you use this to strike a deal

00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:58.544
with the Party for Peace and Freedom
for your own political gain--

00:38:58.627 --> 00:38:59.754
Don't worry.

00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:05.176
Did you forget why I went so far
as to break the law and spread the video?

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:06.969
It was all for the special act.

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:10.056
Hand the ledger over to me.

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.851
I'm the only one
who can pass the special act.

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:53.868
Someone who goes by Secretary Shin said…

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:58.038
that if she had this,

00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.836
she could pass the special act.

00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:30.321
What? I really don't want to give it
to him, but I'm forcing myself to do it

00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:33.282
because my uncle strongly insists.

00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:37.286
And you stop me? You're pissing me off!

00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:46.629
It's okay.

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:48.923
I'll check it first.

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:50.549
The security regulations say…

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.092
Go ahead.

00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:58.432
God…

00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:00.142
You're so thorough.

00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:04.188
You don't even let him
open a bag on his own.

00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:10.110
There's no issue. Would you like to check?

00:42:16.408 --> 00:42:18.452
HASEONG FOUNDATION
PROSECUTOR NOH CHEOL-JAE…

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:26.669
FINANCIAL LEDGER

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.798
HASEONG PETROCHEMICAL

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:33.968
I need an explanation for these.

00:42:36.011 --> 00:42:38.889
Secretary Shin claims
that you can seize control

00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:41.809
of the Party for Peace and Freedom
with these.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.853
You stole from my wife.

00:42:45.854 --> 00:42:48.607
Ki-ju, what did I tell you?

00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:52.111
I said we should've
just handed it over to Secretary Shin.

00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:54.071
Did you hear what he said?

00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:58.367
I knew he would nitpick
saying that I stole them!

00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:03.622
I was even prepared to go to prison
in case things went wrong,

00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:08.294
and he's acting all unbothered.
I knew he would act like this!

00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:13.674
Did you hear that?

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:16.802
Seon-ho couldn't decide
who he should hand those over to.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.138
I told him to give them to you.

00:43:20.055 --> 00:43:21.056
For the last time,

00:43:22.057 --> 00:43:24.184
I'll let myself trust you again.

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:38.115
If you intend to pass the special law
using those,

00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:40.326
drink it up and take them.

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:48.500
If you're going to

00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:51.754
drag your feet the way you have been,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.590
just leave without them.

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:00.846
Why me, not Secretary Shin?

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:08.646
I didn't choose you. I was going to
give them to Secretary Shin.

00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:09.605
Yoon Ki-ju.

00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:12.816
Why me?

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.946
You know I suck
at making this kind of choice.

00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:21.241
So I used my brain.

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.410
"If Tae-hun were here,

00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:26.121
who would he have chosen?"

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.292
WE ARE AGAINST ILLEGAL SUCCESSION

00:45:48.745 --> 00:45:51.206
I heard Lawyer Kang gave you the ledgers.

00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:56.753
Hand them over to me.

00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:59.256
I'll get in contact
with Peace and Freedom Party.

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:24.907
You want to threaten the assemblymen

00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:27.868
and force them to vote in favor?

00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:32.039
Of course.

00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:35.209
We can't be picky with our methods now.

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.461
We must pass the special act--

00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:39.755
What if I insist on the ethical method?

00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:42.508
Will you reveal my weakness?

00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:48.055
I know well that
this isn't how you like to do things.

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:51.725
But at times like this,
you must prioritize the outcome.

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:52.893
"At times like this"?

00:46:54.269 --> 00:46:55.145
"The outcome"?

00:46:57.272 --> 00:46:58.649
Who decides that?

00:47:01.026 --> 00:47:03.153
Who gets to make that choice?

00:47:07.115 --> 00:47:09.117
That's why I said I'd do it myself.

00:47:10.035 --> 00:47:13.455
Just hand over the ledgers and stand back.

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:15.541
Turn a blind eye.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.460
After the special act is passed,

00:47:18.544 --> 00:47:21.630
you can play your role
as the president-elect.

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.217
That's what you took me for.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.263
Someone who dumps
all the responsibilities on you.

00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:36.979
H Hotel was my husband's pride.

00:47:38.063 --> 00:47:41.066
He took me there
even before the construction was finished.

00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:47.447
He was proud of building the tallest hotel
using the soil from the lowest ground.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.951
But on the day of completion,

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:55.289
his claim for worker's compensation
was denied,

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:59.084
and he was investigated
for injury by professional negligence.

00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:02.963
What I've done for the past 20 years
isn't any different.

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:06.174
I served you like your shadow
from the lowest place

00:48:06.758 --> 00:48:08.802
and made you president in the end.

00:48:10.762 --> 00:48:14.683
Please stay someone
I can be proud of.

00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:17.561
You're the president now.

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:19.938
Do what you must as the president.

00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:22.774
This should be my job.

00:48:23.942 --> 00:48:26.028
Let me handle it one last time.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.783
Your job is already done.

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:34.620
President-elect!

00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:36.079
Your 20 years.

00:48:36.663 --> 00:48:38.832
The 20 years you spent for me.

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:45.881
I wished I could stay grateful to you
until the very end.

00:49:02.898 --> 00:49:04.691
This is my job!

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.151
Hand them over to me!

00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:07.986
I told you not to stop me

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.155
when it came to the special act!

00:49:10.238 --> 00:49:12.115
I told you!

00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:13.867
President-elect!

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.953
President-elect…

00:49:21.249 --> 00:49:23.043
President-elect!

00:49:56.785 --> 00:49:59.079
Please stay someone
I can be proud of.

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.872
You're the president now.

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:03.667
Do what you must as the president.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.585
You did the best you could.

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.087
So,

00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:09.881
stop here.

00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:11.341
"If Tae-hun were here,

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.094
who would he have chosen?"

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:41.663
SPECIAL ACT FOR
H CHEMICAL FIRE REINVESTIGATION

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:51.673
FINANCIAL LEDGER

00:50:56.845 --> 00:51:00.098
At the Haseong Interchange,
which leads to Yeouido,

00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:02.684
a one-ton truck suddenly broke down

00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:05.979
creating a massive congestion
around the area.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.900
In certain areas,
cars have come to a standstill,

00:51:09.983 --> 00:51:12.611
it's like a parking lot.

00:51:12.694 --> 00:51:14.988
The police and the expressway corporation

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:17.949
request that drivers avoid the area

00:51:18.033 --> 00:51:20.952
and check live traffic information.

00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:22.162
What happened?

00:51:23.205 --> 00:51:24.456
A truck broke down.

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.459
The police will tow it away,

00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:29.336
but it will take some time.

00:51:42.891 --> 00:51:45.185
You can't go.
Our security regulations say…

00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:02.410
YEAR 2007

00:52:03.995 --> 00:52:05.372
-My hand!
-Tae-hun!

00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:07.874
Tae-hun, what's wrong?

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:08.917
Tae-hun.

00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:13.964
-Call 911!
-Hang in there.

00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:16.132
My hand!

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:17.843
Call 911!

00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:20.512
-Tae-hun.
-Tae-hun.

00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:21.513
Tae-hun.

00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:39.990
President-elect.

00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:01.261
I did as you said.

00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:03.930
Of course.

00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:06.766
I confirmed the President-elect's car.

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:09.936
The voting will start in 30 minutes.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.689
Don't worry. He'll never make it in time.

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:16.776
But must we go this far?

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.487
The party is
against the special act anyway.

00:53:20.488 --> 00:53:22.407
You talk as if you're a politician.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.868
You might soon become one.

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:27.412
I apologize.

00:53:27.495 --> 00:53:28.914
Do you know

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:33.960
why Europeans unnecessarily use forks

00:53:34.586 --> 00:53:36.838
and even knives to have a meal?

00:53:37.923 --> 00:53:40.133
Because they might die

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:43.887
if they let their guard down
and go to a meal empty-handed.

00:53:50.685 --> 00:53:54.689
I'm not only good at arithmetic.
I'm pretty decent in world history.

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.192
It's not over until it's over.

00:53:57.817 --> 00:53:59.319
How many people in history

00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:02.697
do you think died unexpectedly
at the last possible moment?

00:54:02.781 --> 00:54:04.866
That's how Genghis Khan died.

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.660
And so did Napoleon.

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:09.496
Who's to say I won't end up like that?

00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:13.750
So don't say another word

00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:15.502
and keep

00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:18.964
the President-elect tied up in traffic

00:54:19.714 --> 00:54:21.549
until the last possible moment.

00:54:36.898 --> 00:54:39.693
Today, at the 22nd National Assembly's
plenary meeting,

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:42.696
a vote on the Do Tae-hun special act
will take place.

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:45.865
People are paying attention to
whether President-elect Hyun's

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:48.118
first election promise will be fulfilled.

00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:49.119
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:00.839
How may I help you?

00:55:05.343 --> 00:55:09.389
President-elect has just arrived
at the National Assembly.

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:12.475
But instead of his usual state car,

00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:15.770
he arrived
on a traffic cop's motorcycle,

00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:18.064
which is unprecedented.

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:35.915
Congratulations

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.208
on winning the election.

00:55:38.877 --> 00:55:42.464
We should've paid you a visit first,
but you came here before we could.

00:55:45.717 --> 00:55:49.095
From now on, it will be a private meeting.

00:55:49.637 --> 00:55:53.433
President-elect made a difficult decision
and came all the way here.

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:58.063
We should have a heart-to-heart
without the cameras.

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:03.026
Instead of meeting the assemblymen
of Participation People's Party,

00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:05.695
President-elect visited
Party for Peace and Freedom,

00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:08.531
who was having their final meeting
to discuss the vote.

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:11.701
With only ten minutes left
until the voting,

00:56:11.785 --> 00:56:14.287
it is presumed
that President-elect will persuade

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.498
the Party for Peace and Freedom himself.

00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:19.501
If the special act is
still voted down after this,

00:56:19.584 --> 00:56:22.754
President-elect will have to be
politically responsible for it.

00:56:22.837 --> 00:56:23.922
He's facing a trial.

00:56:24.005 --> 00:56:26.257
How dare you barge in here?

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.719
You're not the president yet.

00:56:29.803 --> 00:56:31.221
Show some respect!

00:56:33.264 --> 00:56:34.265
Did you hear that?

00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:37.227
You came here to get some pictures taken

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:38.645
and get it on the news.

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:40.730
"I did everything I could."

00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:43.900
"The act was rejected
because of Party for Peace and Freedom."

00:56:44.526 --> 00:56:48.404
If you intend to spin the story like that,
just kill some time and leave.

00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:52.158
We have less than ten minutes left
until the voting anyway.

00:56:55.328 --> 00:56:56.996
Ten minutes is enough.

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:00.583
But for those ten minutes,

00:57:02.043 --> 00:57:03.044
lend me your ears.

00:57:03.128 --> 00:57:05.547
-What is he saying?
-That's nonsense.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.006
Are you hearing yourself?

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.551
-You're being unreasonable.
-What on earth?

00:57:09.634 --> 00:57:11.052
What does he want to say?

00:57:11.136 --> 00:57:12.554
In ten minutes at that?

00:57:12.637 --> 00:57:14.848
I'd like to thank Party Leader Ju Hyuk-rin

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.724
for arranging this meeting

00:57:16.808 --> 00:57:19.811
so that I could meet
everyone here in person.

00:57:19.894 --> 00:57:21.354
Why did you allow him in?

00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:23.314
What does he want to say?

00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:28.445
I don't think I need to explain why
the Do Tae-hun special act needs to pass.

00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:29.779
Just a few days ago,

00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:32.824
in the meeting held by
formal assemblywoman Bae,

00:57:32.907 --> 00:57:34.325
most of you expressed

00:57:34.826 --> 00:57:36.911
that you were in favor of the act.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:41.332
Instead,

00:57:42.417 --> 00:57:46.212
I'll talk about the obstacle
that hinders you

00:57:47.755 --> 00:57:49.174
from voting for the act.

00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:50.717
You're crossing the line.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.093
What obstacle?

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.929
What on earth are you saying?

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.599
Do you have proof?

00:57:57.682 --> 00:57:59.142
Show us the proof!

00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:13.364
What on earth?

00:58:13.448 --> 00:58:14.699
What's that?

00:58:15.241 --> 00:58:17.118
-What's that?
-What's that?

00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:26.461
Are those really…

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.807
What do you mean?

00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:41.893
He brought the ledgers?

00:58:41.976 --> 00:58:43.269
I mean what I said.

00:58:44.938 --> 00:58:46.481
That's impossible.

00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:57.325
Safe unlocked.

00:58:57.408 --> 00:58:58.993
The door is opening.

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:16.719
The late Cha Jin-taek
left this legacy for my wife.

00:59:17.303 --> 00:59:19.931
The past records
of your party's slush funds

00:59:20.014 --> 00:59:22.850
and the recordings of
some assemblymen's corruptions.

00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:25.061
What slush funds?

00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:27.188
What corruptions?

00:59:27.272 --> 00:59:30.149
If you're here to slander us,
you should go back.

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.737
I have eight minutes left.

00:59:37.115 --> 00:59:39.617
Eight more minutes
for you to listen to me.

00:59:49.168 --> 00:59:51.045
I will return Cha's legacy

00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:54.299
to you guys.

00:59:54.882 --> 00:59:56.968
It belonged to your party to begin with.

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.637
If this legacy

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:04.267
was holding you back
from voting as you wished,

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:07.937
don't worry about it now.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.232
This is the first time

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:13.735
someone has threatened me so openly.

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:15.695
So you're saying

01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:20.491
we should vote for the special act

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:22.493
because you know our secrets?

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:23.995
And become your puppets?

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.664
There are no secrets.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:30.752
There are

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.171
no copies or recordings.

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:36.215
Really?

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:41.888
But

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.265
vote based on

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.894
your individual choice,
not based on your party.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.772
The weight your vote holds…

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.778
Don't share it
with your fellow assemblymen.

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:03.368
The right and responsibility
of the vote belongs

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:05.787
solely to you.

01:01:09.957 --> 01:01:11.918
Don't lay your responsibility
on your party.

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:17.215
Just like how I named the special act
after one person,

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.009
for today's vote,

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:22.804
vote as an individual,

01:01:23.554 --> 01:01:26.265
not as a party member.

01:01:30.144 --> 01:01:32.271
I just want to know.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.816
Fifteen years ago.

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:39.153
April 2, 2012.

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:46.035
Why Tae-hun had to face such a death.

01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:48.913
I just want to know that.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.837
Why people try to stop me
from uncovering that day's truth.

01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:00.758
And what exactly happened on that day.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.349
I must know the truth.

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:50.641
Did you call Reporter Son?

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:53.227
After the interview,
U-yeong will be released.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:55.188
No, I didn't do it.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:58.065
I am President-elect Hyun Min-cheol's…

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:00.735
Is she really your daughter?

01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:02.779
Answer me! Is it true?

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.865
What if the test results say
Lee Hwa-jin isn't his daughter?

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.033
What will you do then?

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:10.578
It's been two months,
and they still haven't found the culprit.

01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:12.872
I want to find the culprit

01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:15.708
who killed my mom.
