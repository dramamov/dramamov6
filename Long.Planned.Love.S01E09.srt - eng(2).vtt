Qin Zhuo,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.280
your apology to me doesn't really help.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.520
After all, this injury of mine

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.140
wasn't caused by you.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.990
Mrs. Zhou,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.910
I'm sorry.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.960
Ms. Mi,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.950
don't feel too wronged.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.760
If you hadn't shown me those photos,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.190
I wouldn't have acted.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.690
We wouldn't be in this mess.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.590
When did I ever show you photos?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.550
You...

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.310
That's suspicious.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.120
She really did show me.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.510
The place you hit me has cameras.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.350
I saw it.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.200
I know I've got nothing to hide.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.000
If you've got nothing to hide,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.070
show me the footage.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.710
Qin Zhuo.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.960
Mm.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.870
Tang said

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.840
she trusts you completely.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.560
She said

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.400
you'd never cheat while engaged.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.310
You don't seem like

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.120
a playboy.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.630
So,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.200
did you actually kiss Mi Shan?

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.550
No, I didn't.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.680
No kiss at all.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.990
So,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.400
that photo was edited then?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.470
I thought it looked fake.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.400
Ms. Mi.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.400
You and I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.680
kind of met through a clash.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.150
I'm actually a photographer.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280
If you need photo edits again,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.120
just call me.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.430
I'll give you a 0.01% discount.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.340
Mr. Zhou, Cheng's wound must stay dry.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.470
Take good care of her.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.960
What about you?

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.190
I'm fine, don't worry.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.240
Leaving with her or with me?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.080
I've still got something to do.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.710
- I'll talk to her...
- Whatever.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.550
You go...

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680
Qin Zhuo.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.590
I'll deal with you.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.710

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.870
It's too late today.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.120
Go to bed first.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.560
We'll pack up tomorrow.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.400
Alright?

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.220
Zhou Tingyan, promise me this now.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.420

Sir.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.060
Get the toiletries ready for her.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.060
Prepare her bath.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.320
(So he really does want to...)

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.940
Alright.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.740
We're home.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.880
Time to open your eyes.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.180

Well,

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.140
didn't you say it'd take five minutes?

The five minutes I meant

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.340
was to give you the ring

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.980
and propose to you.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.220
