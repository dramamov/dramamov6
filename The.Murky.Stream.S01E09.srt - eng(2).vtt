[Eun and Seomseom panting]

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:16.099
My lady. [gasps]

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.019
[sinister music playing]

00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:22.064
My lady, we have to get moving.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.399
We're all going to die
if you waste time here.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.694
We have to move forward, my lady.

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:29.613
We have to hurry!

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.075
[soldier] Find Choi's daughter!

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.677
[pants and whispers]
My lady, hurry. Hurry.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.515
-[gasps]
-[soldier 1] Search everywhere.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.642
[Seomseom] They're after you.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.769
-[soldier 1] This way!
-We're blocked off.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:02.145
We're completely surrounded.

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.982
[soldier 2] She can't have gone far.
Find them now!

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.651
The path to the outskirts is blocked.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.320
There's no way we can get past them.
What do we do?

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:15.033
My lady!
You have to pull yourself together.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:18.036
If we get caught here,
then both of us will get killed.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.705
-Officer Jung.
-What?

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:23.959
He said if I was ever in trouble,
Mapo's Forefinger would help us.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.211
We need to find him.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.964
We'll find out where he is together.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.509
[breathing heavily] All right. This way.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.094
[both panting]

[boatman] What are you going to do?
The sun will rise soon.

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:49.443
Chief Kang.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:02:00.245
Listen, if I'm not there on time,
you must go alone.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.706
My lord.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.626
All of our lives depend on the map,
making it safely.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:08.462
I'm counting on you.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.549
We have to go.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.554
Oh, over there.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.767
[breath trembling]

-[Captain Park] That way.
-[soldiers] Yes, sir!

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.361
I think it's too late, my Lord.

-[door opens]
-[Seomseom] My lady.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.675
Oh, my lady. It's okay.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.052
You're all right now.
You're safe. You're safe.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.598
I had a nightmare.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.726
A terrible nightmare.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:07.771
What?

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.148
It was just a bad dream, right?

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.026
Right, Seomseom?

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:19.658
Right?

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.245
My lady...

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.163
[crying]

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.133
[sighs softly]

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.093
Where are we right now?

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.266
Tell me it wasn't real.

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.144
Oh, my lady...

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.566
[both crying]

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.027
Oh, my lady...

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:18.258
And Choi's daughter?

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.135
Well, Siyul had a plan.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.429
He hid her at his old home.
She'll be safe there.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.931
Now we're stuck taking care
of some random girl

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.183
that fell out of the sky.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.726
Last night...

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.605
Choi's Guild was accused of treason,
and they were all put to the sword.

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.732
What does Siyul have to do with that?

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.734
They're chasing down the rest.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.111
The ones who got out
are being hunted like dogs.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:40.864
Can you really call that living?
I don't think so.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.741
Sounds like that family's trouble.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.659
Oh, shit.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:46.495
[sighs]

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.497
Actually, I grew up here.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.750
You and the lady should stay here.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.337
Thank you very much.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.005
It's a complete mess out there.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.925
They've issued a warrant for your arrest.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.135
They've eyes everywhere
and it's getting worse.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.222
So how did this happen?

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.271
I have something to show you.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.825
Is this... This is a map.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.326
Boss, you in there?

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.250
What have you been able to uncover?

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.212
[thuds]

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.756
This is all...

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.259
I could get out of there.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.943
This is...

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.571
This is Chun's sword, isn't it?

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.075
[fabric rustling]

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:16.668
[hesitates] Where is he...

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.087
without his blade?

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.716
Well, that's the thing.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.012
Your friend, Assistant Officer Jung...

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.097
[ominous music playing]

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.807
He's in front of the city wall.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:33.935
[somber music playing]

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.322
[Captain Park] Listen carefully.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.075
"If you find any family members
or anyone connected to the traitors,

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.245

"If you disobey
and are caught hiding them,

-Seomseom?
-[Seomseom sniffles]

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.496
[grunts] My lady?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.210
Are you feeling any better now?

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.504
That light outside the door...

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.052
Is that the light of dusk
or the light of dawn?

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.221
The light of dawn, my lady.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.348
Could we open the door then?

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.016
Yes.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:01.856
[music continues]

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.870
This is what Chun was fighting for?

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.417
What he was protecting?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.002
This map was created
in preparation for war.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.966
And according to my lord, Choi,
it could save Joseon.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:32.053
I'm not asking for your help
just for my sake.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:37.434
Both my father and Officer Jung
gave their lives for this.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.812
Help us fulfill their duty.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.525
[door opens]

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.612
What's with
all the pointless chatter, huh?

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.866
-Mudeok--
-Save your breath.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.870
I already heard everything,
and I'm not gonna help you.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.373
So let's just pretend I didn't
hear anything or see anything.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.375
It's time to get out of here. Got that?

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.585
Hurry your asses on out.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.669
Mudeok sir...

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.337
Our lives are on the line here.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.673
We need your help. I'm begging you.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:11.009
Now you're just spouting some bullshit.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.511
You think I'm gonna risk my life
to help you?

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:16.056
They execute those who harbor traitors,
you know that.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.017
How dare you call them traitors?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.351
They were righteous people.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.771
That's neither here
nor there, little girl.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.274
Don't even think about settling down here
and planting roots.

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.693
The government will hear
about you, real fast.

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:29.778
What if...

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.906
we could come to an agreement instead?

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.118
I know you care for money.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.914
You're not serious, are you?

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.291
Money from a Traitor's Guild
is worth shit.

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:44.584
It's nothing but paper.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.711
You should find somebody else.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.843
This is a Songbang promissory note.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.847
Two thousand nyang for immediate use.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.725
What the... 2,000 nyang?

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.899
That's enough to buy several houses
in the finest neighborhood.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.401
You will never have to worry
about money again.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.029
And also...

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.907
title deeds for a ginseng farm.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.119
-Everything you need and more.
-Please, my lady.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.371
This is all I have to my name.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.166
[Walwal] My goodness...

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.293
[stutters] What an offer.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:28.378
What did I say?

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.381
I told you she wouldn't
take no for an answer.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.342
Um... Uh...

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.512
I mean, we should hear her out.
Let her finish.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:40.932
If the price doesn't please you,
I will look for someone else then.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.475
-No, hold on.
-No, wait, wait.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.102
-Don't go.
-Hold on.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.895
[comical music playing]

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.566
The lady should at least
let us mull it over.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.153
What are your terms, though?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.953
I need a boat procured.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:03.788
[gasps]

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.791
Find us a boat
that'll make it to Ganghwado.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:12.922
[exhales]

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:29.189
-[grunts]
-Go away.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.410
Have you forgotten, my lady?

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.037
These are bandits.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.873
Who knows what it is they're scheming?

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.625
They could take our money,

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.085
hand us over to the police bureau,
or worse.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.087
It couldn't get worse than this.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.883
So I don't think it matters much.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.220
[scoffs]

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.724
The way that you made that deal
reminded me of your father.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.646
I may not know him well, but...

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.233
the Forefinger of Mapo...

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.486
he seems trustworthy to me.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:18.446
Yes.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:21.115
However, the thumb's a different story.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.409
You don't trust Mudeok?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.120
It's difficult to tell
what his intentions are.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.292

[both panting]

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.387
Where is the map?

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.138
Where?

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.475
Just give me three days
to find them, General.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:48.685
[scoffs]

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.187
You think you have three days?

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.356
You won't have a neck
in three days.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.316
I blocked all the exits.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.069
Every single waterway, path, and alley.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.824
How could a mere disgraced woman
escape all this?

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.117
Fine then.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.870
Just keep this in mind.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:11.833
If you fail,
I'll shove a bull stick down your throat.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.252
Understand?

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:15.670
[ominous music playing]

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:20.842
[sighs wearily]

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:25.305
Are you saying you haven't even
laid your eyes on the map?

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.640
[trembling] My sincerest apologies,
my lord.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.226
I think I may have overestimated you.

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:34.522
Judging by the way you're
handling this situation,

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:38.026
you don't seem to deserve to be
the general of the Left Police Bureau.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.570
[gasps] That's not true, my lord.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.405
Do not forget...

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:46.284
your neck could easily end up
on the chopping block with the traitors.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.911
I swear I will heed your warning.

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.706
I'll engrave it in my heart.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:53.583
[Lord Oh] Leave.

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:04.427
Lord Oh.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.137
Yes?

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.806
The culling
of the Senior Guardian General's life

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.475
was not the sole objective.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.310
I'm well aware, Your Highness.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:15.813
In order to wrap a noose
around the Seoin's necks,

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.523
we must have a clear cause.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:23.488
No longer will any of these filthy and
impure forces disrupt the court's purity.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.615
That aside...

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:28.910
the assistant officer who just left...

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.537
don't you think he knows too much here?

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.791
Not to mention his conduct.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.585
He still has some use left as a pawn.

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:40.296
And he is more loyal than he appears.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:43.132
Don't concern yourself
with him, Your Highness.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.342
So you say.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.095
Is this hard for you to comprehend?

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.430
Do you burn yourself to learn fire is hot?

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.724
[sighs] Not at all.

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.268
Hesitating means we lose.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.728
We must be two steps ahead.

00:14:56.687 --> 00:15:00.024
By your command, I will do as you wish.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:05.238
We only have one life,
so why waste it living frugally?

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.161
At the end of it, all our bodies die
before rotting to dust.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.455
Half measures get you nowhere.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.252
[birds chirping]

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.673
[whispers] Here.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.925
-Keep your word.
-Of course.

[sighs wearily]

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.536
It's tomorrow at dawn.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:57.707
[grunts] The boat will set off then,
at the hour of the tiger.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.209
Thank you for doing this.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:02.587
[Mudeok] Siyul...

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.213
Yes?

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.386
If you have something to say, then...

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.430
you should say it.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.019
It's nothing important.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.189
Please take care of yourself.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:25.735
May your life be long.

00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:27.945
Hey...

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:32.408
you worried that I'm gonna die?

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:35.703
[chuckles]

[sighs]

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.707
Save your worry for yourselves.

[in Manchu] The doctor...
What did he say?

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.174
The stab wound is too deep.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.510
So he cannot tell
whether she will live or not.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.555
Do you blame me?

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.307
You took us in and raised us.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.602
When my sister and I lived like beasts
eating rotten food.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.773
How could we ever blame you?

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.693
Everyone dies.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.238

[Mudeok] You can bring it with you...

Go wherever you want.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.261
I will give back
what I owe you before I do.

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.431
Have you considered
the consequences at all?

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:22.018
After you cause a scene
and leave us all here?

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.103
Do you think we can survive on our own?

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.314
[crying]

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.401
[Siyul] Take my letter...

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.029
and do whatever you want with it.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.781
And I will do what I have to do.

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.535
[Mudeok] You idiot!

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.246
So we'll be stuck
eating filthy rice again,

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.914
and it'll all be thanks to you?

You had something to say?

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.711
Take a seat.

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.930
Well, you see...

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:49.480
I know where the daughter
of the Choi Guild is hiding.

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:51.649
I can tell you, my lord.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.736
What did you just say?

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.156
Right now...

00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:01.575
she's hiding in Taeseong-ri.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.578
In a vacant house on top of a hill.

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:07.957
You're certain of this?

00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:09.792
Yes.

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.502
I'm certain.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.587
I saw her with my own two eyes.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.553
Curious...

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.890
Tell me, how did you figure this out?

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:28.477
I know the one who helped that woman hide.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.690
A member of my own clan.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.317
My forefinger!

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.278
He's your forefinger.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.030
That can only mean Jang.

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:41.115
Yes.

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.993
[scoffs] What a daring man!

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.661
So, tell me...

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:49.165
Why would he hide that woman
from Choi's Guild?

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:53.878
By doing that, he'd be putting
his own life on the line.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.505
The boy wants revenge.

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.509
Right now,
that's what's driving him, my lord.

00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:03.137
Revenge, you say?

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:09.602
[breath trembling]

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:21.405
JUNG CHUN

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:22.573
What's this?

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.743
Was this letter
written by our late Officer Jung?

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.704
You'll want to take a look
at who it's addressed to.

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:32.500
That's Jang's true name, the one he hid.

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.505
Jang Siyul.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.261
Jang Siyul and Assistant Officer Jung,
they were both from Gyeongwonjin.

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:49.225
When Siyul lost his mother during the war
and became an orphan,

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.062
Jung's mother took him in
and raised them like brothers.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.147
[ominous music playing]

00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:01.779
Those two may not have shared blood,
but they were basically family.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.662
[bamboo creaking]

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:14.333
[Lee Dolgae] Yes.

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:19.171
This is all starting to make
much more sense to me now.

00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:23.425
Every time he was involved,
Officer Jang made such a fuss.

00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:25.177
I always wondered why.

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.263
How very interesting.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:29.890
That's not all.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.852
Malbok's killer, Wang Hae...

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:37.273
he was the one who killed Siyul's mother
during the invasion.

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:44.446
To make matters worse, he struck down
the man Siyul called brother.

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.617
There's no question
as to why he craves revenge.

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:52.580
[Lee Dolgae] What a truly amusing fate.

00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:55.541
I'm certain of it.

00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:01.589
If it's for the sake of vengeance,
there's nothing that can hold him back.

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:19.189
The daughter of the Choi family,
last night, she offered me a deal.

00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:23.611
She said If I helped her cross the river,
then I would get a large payout.

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:25.154
So you're saying...

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.699
they're going to cross the river.

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.118
They'll run using the waterways.

00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:33.078
At dawn tomorrow.

00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:35.998
That's when they plan to go,
when the tide is at its highest.

00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:39.084
Where will they go?

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:41.837
I can't say, my lord.

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.298
It was kept secret
in case someone turned them in.

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:50.429
Answer this.

00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:52.973
What made you decide to turn her in?

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.520
That money was yours for the taking.

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:05.903
You're asking why?

00:24:09.907 --> 00:24:12.368
I'd do anything to protect my family.

00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:15.079
Either I turned my back on him...

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:18.624
or he turns his back on me.

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:22.461
I don't see any other options.

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:29.134
My lord, please protect us.

00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:30.970
[breath trembling]

00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:32.846
He's endangering my family.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:39.687
I'm afraid they're going to get hurt

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.314
all because of this.

00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:49.196
