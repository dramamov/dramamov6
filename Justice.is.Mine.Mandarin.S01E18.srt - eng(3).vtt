WEBVTT

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.920
Lin Qian wouldn't just disappear.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.320
Han Kui Long is her man.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.759
She must have seen...

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.920
the scar on his body long ago.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.280
She has disappeared now.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.559
There are only two possibilities.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.360
First, she told Han Kui Long to run.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.120
Second, she killed him for revenge.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.559
Okay, I'll send someone to the hospital right away.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.040
I'll also notify customs.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.680
I'll apply for a search warrant.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.120
I'm afraid she didn't get her revenge...

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.720
and ended up getting killed instead.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680
What are you doing?

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:31.119
We can't save him anymore!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.359
Going in now is suicide!

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.480
Mr. Long is still inside!

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.519
Young Master Lie told us to swear on our lives...

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.279
to keep Mr. Long safe!

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.360
I know! Calm down!

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.760
Listen to me!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're doomed.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.240
Let's go!

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
I can't reach Xiao Lu.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.960
Mr. Long and the others didn't get on the boat at all.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.080
(Justice is Mine)

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.120
(Episode 18)

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
Judge Qin.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120
Inspector Tang.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
I need to apply...

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.840
for a search warrant for Han Kui Long's house.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
On what grounds?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.000
Lin Qian's personal safety is threatened.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560
Why?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.040
Why did you give me...

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.520
the A05 witness statement?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.880
Did you already know...

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200
that the real culprit of the arson...

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560
was Han Kui Long?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160
I didn't know.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.600
The A05 statement was just a clue.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
The outcome...

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.640
is out of my control.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.400
I can't believe that after all this,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.719
Han Kui Long...

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.840
is in our hands again.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.200
- Stop filming! - What's the situation?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.000
- Step back! - The fire inside is under control.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.400
We only found one body so far.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440
Okay.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520
Thank you.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.960
Who's the victim?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.960
It's your father, Han Kui Long.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.559
- Madam. - What's the situation?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.159
We found the burnt body of a man.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.680
We've confirmed that it's Han Kui Long.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840
There's no sign of Lin Qian.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.160
The guys are still collecting evidence.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400
No way.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.240
- You can't go in there! - Get out!

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.039
- Calm down. - I'm very calm.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040
- Calm down. - I'm calm.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.680
I just want to see if it's my dad.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120
- You can't go in! - Don't go in!

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
- Get out! Hold on to him! - Get out!

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.440
- No! - Let me go!

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.319
Let me go! Dad!

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.440
- Young Master Lie! - Dad!

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
- Don't go in! - Dad!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680
- Young Master Lie, calm down! - Dad!

00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:18.320
- Mr. Han Lie, calm down! - Calm down!

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.160
- Get him out of here. - Calm down!

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.679
Young Master Lie, listen.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680
Young Master Lie.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760
Young Master Lie.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.520
Han Kui Long escaped from the hospital...

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.480
and violated the terms of his medical parole.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.800
We need you to come with us for questioning.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240
Of course.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.400
We can take you to the morgue first...

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.160
so you can complete the body identification process.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.280
Are there any other bodies in there?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.920
There was only one male body in the house.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.680
Is this your father?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.200
It is my dad.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760
Han Kui Long.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.160
Get the car ready.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040
Bring Dad home.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.080
I got it.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400
Not yet.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.240
We still need to do an autopsy.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.640
He was obviously burned to death.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.360
What's there to examine?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.199
This is normal police procedure.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.240
It's not personal to any of you.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.040
And Mr. Han,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.079
we'll be inviting you back to the station...

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080
to assist with the investigation.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120
My condolences.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.440
I have nothing to say.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.920
I don't know...

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840
why my dad was there either.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.360
What do you think...

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.280
about his death?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.240
My dad died like that.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.840
Apart from being sad,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.240
I'm also angry.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.160
Your dad had so many enemies.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560
Who do you think...

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.200
had the most opportunity to kill him?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.320
Are you sure it was murder?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.000
Once the autopsy report is out,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520
we'll know for sure.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.880
Let's wait for the autopsy report then.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.680
Lin Qian has disappeared.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.640
Aren't you worried?

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840
Aren't you nervous?

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.600
If I told you that I'm looking for her too,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040
would you believe me?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.919
Where was the last place...

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.920
that you saw her?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.400
Who was she with?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.360
Or let me make...

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.400
a bold deduction.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.359
Maybe someone wanted to take his dad's place...

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.000
and did something heinous.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.720
Someone else saw it,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.280
so he killed her to silence her.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880
Inspector Tang!

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.840
You have a wild imagination.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.800
If you want to interrogate me,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.360
get my lawyer here.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.640
That won't be necessary for now.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.200
But get a good lawyer ready.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.760
You're quite worked up, Madam.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.519
He just lost his dad,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520
yet you're interrogating him like this.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600
I don't think he did it.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.720
Could Lin Qian be the murderer?

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.280
But Lin Qian has gone into hiding.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.200
Or has she really been silenced?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120
Young Master Lie.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.040
Officer Da and Councilor Huang are here.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.080
What did you tell him when you saw him two days ago?

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.640
What could I have said?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.120
I just urged him to enjoy his golden years...

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.520
and to stop causing trouble...

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.480
for a dead man like Han Gang.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.720
He wouldn't listen.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.600
I thought someone wanted to teach him a lesson.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.240
I think his girlfriend is missing too.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.240
We can't find her body.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.960
The land acquisition plan is about to start.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.120
Let's think about how to control this situation.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800
I'm sorry.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.760
Young Master Lie is still very emotional.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.080
Please understand.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880
We understand.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.039
Please tell him...

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.040
that we're sorry for his loss.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.399
There's one more important thing.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400
I hope you can pass on the message.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.800
Whatever it was like in the past,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.480
it will continue to be the same in the future.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.640
It won't change.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240
I'll convey your message...

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.640
to Young Master Lie.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.680
Thank you.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.120
Lin Qian has been with Han Kui Long for about 20 years.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.320
Although she basically doesn't get involved with triad matters,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.879
her social circle...

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.400
is all related to the Han family.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.400
Simply put, Lin Qian...

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600
doesn't have many friends.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.040
I'm sure she has something to do with Han Kui Long's death.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.680
If she's not dead,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.479
we have to find her before Han Lie does.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480
Madam.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480
The autopsy report is out.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.720
Han Kui Long didn't die from the fire.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.439
The cause of death was asphyxiation...

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.440
due to airway obstruction.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.599
According to the medical examiner, no burn marks were found...

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.840
in the victim's lungs.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.800
However, a type of fiber was found.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.359
It perfectly matches the material of the pillow...

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360
found at the scene.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.000
We believe he was smothered to death...

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.400
with a pillow before the fire.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.960
Han Kui Long was smothered with a pillow?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280
Even though he was old,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.920
it wouldn't have been easy to kill him that way.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
That's the key.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.999
Forensics found tranquilizers and naloxone...

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.480
in his blood.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.080
Naloxone?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.200
That means the killer...

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.320
knocked him out,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600
then woke him up,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.560
and then smothered him with a pillow.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.920
After that, they set the fire?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440
No way.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.640
If you found out that you had been deceived...

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.000
by the person closest to you for over 20 years,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.120
doing something like this wouldn't be strange at all.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.080
For now,

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.280
we need to find Lin Qian as soon as possible.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.240
- Let's get to work! - Yes, Madam.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.240
Why are you here to see me?

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.680
Can you tell me...

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.800
what happened these past few days?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.520
Did you come to see me...

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.240
because of my relationship with Shi Zhi Yang?

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.200
Or is it because I'm a cop?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.800
It's because you're a cop.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.280
Chief Justice Qin, Inspector Tang is here.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080
Thank you.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.360
Have a seat.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.240
I went to Mr. Fei's earlier.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.360
I bought an extra cup of coffee for you.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.520
There's a case...

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.720
I'd like your professional opinion on.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.080
Lin Qian...

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.480
is a survivor of the Huyan Wooden Shed Area fire.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.400
She killed Han Kui Long...

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.280
to get justice...

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.880
for her family and all the victims.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.800
Now,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.960
she wants to turn herself in.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
That's simple.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520
According to protocol,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.920
just submit the case for prosecution.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.080
The lead that Han Kui Long was the real arsonist...

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.039
came from the A05 statement...

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.600
that you gave me.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.919
When Shi Zhi Yang asked you about it,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920
you didn't say anything.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.640
But later, you gave this statement to me.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.760
What was the reason?

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
Who would have the ability...

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.040
to frame a chief inspector?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.000
He must be very familiar...

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.760
with police operations.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
Moreover,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440
he is able to mobilize...

00:12:46.441 --> 00:12:47.640
all kinds of resources,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.360
so he must be in a very high position...

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.560
within the police force.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080
To put it bluntly,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.640
it's Da Gama.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.840
You knew there was a chance to point the finger at him,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.840
but you still gave me this statement.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560
That means...

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.440
we have a common goal.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.200
We can work together...

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.920
to arrest these criminals.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.680
What if I don't work with you?

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280
Then I'll have to...

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.520
reveal the source of the A05 statement.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.240
Inspector Tang, you've changed a lot.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.640
I'm learning from you.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Thank you.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840
Are you okay?

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.560
My condolences.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.920
When I first met you,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.400
my brother was still unconscious,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720
and my dad was still alive.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.360
But in the blink of an eye,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.440
they're all gone now.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.640
I'm the only one left.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680
Don't you still...

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.680
have your men by your side?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.200
If I give up everything,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720
will you accept me?

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.680
Can you do that?

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280
I still...

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.400
have to do what I need to do.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920
You must be tired.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.280
Go home and rest.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.280
Upholding the rule of law...

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.440
requires efforts from all sectors of society.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.359
It was a pleasure...

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.720
to have many legal experts invited by Councilor Huang...

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.040
to share their opinions today.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.840
Councilor Huang.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.239
I'm grateful to Judge Qin...

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.960
for facilitating this theoretical and practical exchange.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.520
After our discussion, we realized...

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.799
that upholding the rule of law...

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.920
is a long and arduous task,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.080
especially for vulnerable groups.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.040
How society can defend their legitimate rights...

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.480
is worth further exploration.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040
Councilor,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.680
how do you think vulnerable groups...

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.600
should defend their rights?

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.960
We're not experts in that area.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.999
I think it's best left...

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
to legal professionals to resolve.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.720
Then I'll make a request here.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320
Will you help me?

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800
My name is Lin Qian.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.760
I'm Han Kui Long's woman.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.640
I'm also his killer.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.680
Killer?

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.120
I'm here today to demand...

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.960
that Han Kui Long's case...

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.560
receive a fair trial.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.560
I won't allow powerful individuals...

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.440
to manipulate or interfere.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.120
Who are you referring to?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.760
Yes, who is it?

00:18:09.761 --> 00:18:11.400
- Please say a few more words. - Yes, please say more.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.239
- Please say more. - Ms. Lin, please say more.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.520
- Tell us more. - Yes, Ms. Lin.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040
I want to see Lin Qian.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.799
Lin Qian is suspected of murder.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800
She's in custody.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.760
No one can see her, except her lawyer.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360
What?

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.800
Do you think we'll let you go in to kill her off?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.960
Do you know what place this is?

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.280
Even if I don't see her today,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.200
she'll be in my hands eventually.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.160
Then explain your plan to me clearly...

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.680
so I can arrest you right now.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Let him in.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.200
Lin Qian is willing to see him.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520
Why?

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.320
You were with my dad for over 20 years.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.240
Dad trusted you so much.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360
Why?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.600
I was with your dad for over 20 years.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.640
We slept in the same bed every night.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.240
Yes.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.640
He trusted me a lot.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.960
But he didn't tell me...

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.200
that he was the murderer who killed my entire family.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640
What's going on?

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.000
I know you're the one...

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.240
who set fire to the Wooden Shed Area back then.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.600
You're the one who killed my parents...

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.640
and my little brother.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.320
I just envy you.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880
Back then,

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.319
thanks to you burning down the Wooden Shed Area,

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.360
we were able to seize the opportunity to earn riches.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440
Who knew...

00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:14.759
that your biggest gain from it...

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.840
would be becoming a Casanova?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.680
Let me go first.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.240
We can...

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.200
talk this through.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.920
You killed 104 people.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.280
Why didn't you kill me too?

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.480
Why did you keep me by your side for 20 years?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.240
Da Gama was right.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.840
Seeking fortune requires taking risks.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480
That fire...

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.599
Even if I didn't start it,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.720
he would've gotten someone else to do it.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.560
The Wooden Shed Area burned down 20 years ago.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.320
Over the past 20 years,

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.560
think about how I've treated you.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.680
We have real feelings for each other.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.760
Think about our future.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.399
Stop talking!

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.559
If you wanted me dead,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.240
you wouldn't have woken me up, right?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.600
After all this time with me,

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.399
why have you still not learned anything?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.800
You still don't understand.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320
In this world,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.480
all transactions...

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.400
are unfair!

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.240
The one who gains the most...

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.040
is the winner.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.560
I don't know you.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.640
I don't know you!

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.880
Even if you kill me,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.320
you won't be the ultimate winner.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680
If I die,

00:21:39.681 --> 00:21:41.759
the whole Han family will come looking for you.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.600
You'll wish you were dead.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240
Let me go!

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160
What are you doing?

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.000
The culprit of the Wooden Shed Area arson...

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.200
ended up dying in a fire.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.160
Isn't this fate?

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.360
It's not fate.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.680
It's murder.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.480
I agreed to see you today...

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.040
to give you an explanation...

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.080
because you always greeted me with respect.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.239
No matter what he did, he's still my dad.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240
Hey!

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.320
Sooner or later,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.720
you'll have to pay for this.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.079
I got justice...

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.680
for 104 lives.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.440
104 lives!

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.560
Exchanging my life for their justice?

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560
It's worth it.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.920
Time's up.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120
Let's go.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240
Let's go.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.600
Is there a way to keep Lin Qian from appearing in court?

00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800
What are you worried about?

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.160
Han Kui Long was a crafty man.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.719
How would I know if he hid something...

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720
to protect himself?

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.360
His woman turned her back on him.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.560
I don't want her to expose me...

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.000
in court.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.640
Of course not.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.519
This is strange.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.320
Even I don't know where they hid that woman.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.160
I haven't heard anything at all.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600
The most important thing now...

00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:26.360
is for you not to panic.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040
Hey.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.760
I just made a promise to the public...

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.440
that I'll protect the rights of the vulnerable.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.080
I can't go back on my word now.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.440
I guess she doesn't have any solid evidence.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.960
Maybe I'm too nervous.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800
Don't worry.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.760
Judge Qin is the presiding judge this time.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.800
He's one of us. It'll be fine.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
That's a relief.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.080
Should we save him?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.040
Let's not waste time.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.120
What's the name of the person who works for him?

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960
It's Zheng A Gen.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.040
Zheng A Gen...

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680
Your Honor.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.880
The defendant turned herself in and confessed to her crime,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.000
and the details of the murder she confessed to...

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.640
match the crime scene evidence.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.280
The cause of death...

00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:32.960
also matches the medical examiner's report.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.079
So the prosecution and the defendant...

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.520
have reached a plea agreement.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.960
The content of the agreement has been submitted to the court.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.040
Defendant, are you choosing to defend yourself...

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200
and not appoint a lawyer?

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320
I admit to the murder.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720
There's no need to defend myself.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.520
But I would like to say...

00:26:48.521 --> 00:26:49.560
why I committed the murder.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.440
Defendant, you may begin.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.440
My name is Lin Qian.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.520
I am a survivor...

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.360
of the Huyan Wooden Shed Area arson.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.040
That fire...

00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:02.760
killed 104 people,

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.200
including my parents...

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800
and my brother.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.999
The real arsonist...

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.040
was a man I lived with for 20 years.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.240
When I found out the truth,

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.440
I questioned him.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.840
But he didn't show any remorse.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.359
I know the law...

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.640
can't punish such a person.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.160
So, I killed him.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.719
I want justice for the people...

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.840
who died in that fire.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800
The trial just started.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.440
Don't be so nervous.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.320
They didn't stop Lin Qian from appearing in court,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.320
nor did they eliminate the risks.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.120
That means I'm no longer useful.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.640
They've given up on me.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.039
It has been over 20 years.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.040
You've helped them out of a lot of trouble.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.520
It's because I helped them with so many troubles...

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.440
that I know very well what tricks they're playing.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.440
Then how did you find out the truth?

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.560
Han Kui Long...

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.200
had a private conversation...

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.200
with the mastermind of the fire.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.800
I recorded it.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.479
Recording File Number 12...

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.080
has been submitted as evidence.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.600
You may play it.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.480
Back then,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.839
thanks to you burning down the Wooden Shed Area,

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.880
we were able to seek fortune through this risk.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.159
Who knew...

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.160
that your biggest gain from it...

00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:27.399
would be becoming a Casanova?

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.559
Cut the crap.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.560
Just get to the point.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.719
The Wooden Shed Area fire...

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.999
is the bargaining chip that gave us our first pot of gold.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.120
This chip...

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.679
can be exchanged for the future profits...

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.000
of the Old City District's development.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.520
It's our harvest season for wealth and riches.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840
After that,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.279
we can enjoy our golden years in peace.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280
Isn't that good?

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600
By the way,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.920
aren't you afraid they'll issue an exit ban?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.440
I already expected it.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.600
That's why I prepared two fake passports.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.640
I also bought tickets to different countries.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.120
It's like an insurance.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.600
It's important to know how to improvise.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.560
Officer Da, if you want to leave,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.920
it looks like I'll be the only friend to see you off.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.000
In this recording,

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.480
who is the the person...

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760
speaking to the victim, Han Kui Long?

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.480
He's a high-ranking police officer,

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.840
Chief Superintendent Da Gama.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320
It's him?

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.680
This case has been handed over to the Regional Headquarters.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.880
Forensics searched the scene.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.560
They didn't find a suicide note.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.280
In that case,

00:30:14.281 --> 00:30:17.400
Da Gama seems to have committed suicide out of guilt.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.760
Was it really suicide?

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960
Or was he sacrificed?

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.800
Anyway, now that he's dead,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
we've lost our lead.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560
Without any leads,

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.360
we can't find out who's behind him.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.720
It'll be even harder...

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.680
to overturn Shi Zhi Yang's case.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360
You're right.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.080
Hello.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.400
Okay, thank you.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.200
Da Gama's assistant turned himself in.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.920
He wants to turn state's evidence.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160
Zheng A Gen.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.639
You're a cop, so I won't explain...

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.760
the terms for turning state's evidence.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040
Tell us.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.040
What crimes did you commit for Da Gama?

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.320
Da Gama...

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.640
was the mastermind of the Huyan Wooden Shed Area arson.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.119
He found out that...

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.400
Shi Zhi Yang was secretly going through old records,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.000
so he ordered me to take care of this mess...

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.920
and get rid of this potential threat.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.519
A Gen's conditions to turn state's evidence...

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.520
have been settled.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.920
He has already exposed...

00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:23.080
where Shi Zhi Yang's real killer is hiding.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800
Action.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.400
Police on duty!

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.640
Show me your ID.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.320
Here.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920
Catch.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.680
Be quiet.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040
Close the door.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.280
Stop. Go back to your room.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.000
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640
Guo Hua, take care of Liang Jie.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.360
Don't move.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.280
Go in! Go down and help!

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.080
Today,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.920
based on newly acquired evidence,

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.120
the court will retry the murder case...

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.440
of former police officer Shi Zhi Yang.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.160
(The honorable Mr. Shi Zhi Yang's grave)

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.920
You said Shi Zhi Yang's death...

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.600
was instigated by Da Gama.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.680
He did it to cover up...

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.640
the truth behind the Huyan arson case back then.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.880
Framing Shi Zhi Yang...

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.360
and the arson case back then...

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.800
were all instigated by Da Gama.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.240
I was just following orders.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.040
I just communicated with the people in charge of committing the crimes.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.439
A Gen did as instructed.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.080
He pinned all the crimes on Da Gama.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.240
He will only receive a light sentence...

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560
for the crimes he admitted to.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.400
I didn't directly participate in any murder.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I hereby declare...

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.480
the retraction of all untrue accusations...

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.040
against Shi Zhiyang...

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.840
for abusing his power to commit crimes.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.000
And other individuals involved in this case...

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.400
will be considered for retrial...

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.840
on charges of obstruction of justice.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.280
He was actually a good cop.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.400
The 104 lives got their justice.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.320
You did it.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.000
Han Kui Long and Da Gama...

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.320
both got what they deserved.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.000
You can rest in peace now.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.560
Get more footage later.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.399
- Judge Qin is here. - He's here.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.479
- Judge Qin! - Judge Qin!

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.519
- Judge Qin. - Please comment on the case...

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.639
that concluded today.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.159
- Tell us more. - Say something.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.720
- Yes. - First of all, dear reporters,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.560
please allow me to make a simple statement.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.920
Due to the previous fabrication of evidence,

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.440
I misjudged Mr. Shi Zhi Yang's case.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800
I hereby...

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.400
offer my sincerest apologies.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.880
Mr. Shi Zhi Yang...

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.400
was a model police officer.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.240
His dedication to the rule of law...

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.759
and justice in this city...

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.880
is admirable,

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.960
praiseworthy, and commendable.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.760
Even if you don't like it,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.120
to be fair,

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.920
the script for this show was quite good.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.600
The scriptwriter was quite ruthless.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.040
Da Gama was such an important character.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.360
He died so quickly.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.600
Don't worry.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.960
As long as the role is important,

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.840
we can always find someone...

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.200
to replace him.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.800
So I guess the show...

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
is over?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
What's the hurry?

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.160
There's still one more good show.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.400
Lin Qian.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.360
Hey!

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.440
I'm already paying his debt for him.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.200
Why are you still beating him?

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.200
Paying the debt is one thing.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.879
Beating people up is their fun. They beat whoever they want.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.880
They're crazy!

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.399
Brat! What are you looking at?

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.880
Want me to gouge your eyes out?

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.200
I've already delivered the goods for you and paid you back.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.079
Stop beating him.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080
Delivered the goods?

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.200
Delivered what?

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.039
- Who asked you to deliver anything? - What did you say?

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.040
- What are you doing? - Stop talking nonsense!

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.200
What are you doing?

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.480
All of you, stand still!

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.720
Hands up!

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560
Search them!

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.039
- What's wrong with him? - Officer.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.319
He's having an asthma attack. He'll die without his medicine!

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.400
Take him back to his cell!

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400
Be careful.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160
Are you all right?

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.040
Here, sit down.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120
What's the matter?

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280
You...

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.520
Did you see my inhaler?

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.080
You can't find it?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.320
I'll help you look for it.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.840
Get up first.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.440
Sit up. Sit.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.040
Have you found it?

00:40:49.041 --> 00:40:50.080
I can't find it.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.440
Here, eat this.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.319
You'll feel better if you eat this.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.320
Here.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.720
What is this?

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.120
It's specifically for asthma.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240
Give me your hand.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.439
You'll be fine once you take this.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.440
It's for asthma.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480
Eat it.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.480
Eat it. Come on.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440
Have some water.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.560
Look.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.320
You're fine now.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.680
Dad.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.720
Yi Wei.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280
What's wrong?

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400
Did you not sleep well?

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.120
No.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.360
By the way,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.440
I had a dream last night.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.880
I dreamed of playing baseball with you.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.920
Really?

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640
Then...

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:09.760
I'll go and practice.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.520
When you get out, I'll play with you.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920
That sounds good.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.400
Have you been reading?

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.640
You'll be out soon.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.160
When you get out,

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.080
we'll be like before.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.560
I'll go to work, and you'll go to school.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.080
You can get a girlfriend.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.280
We can cook at home when we have time.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.000
Or we can travel together.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.840
Let's invite Grandma too.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.600
Of course.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.880
(Shi Zhi Yang)

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.640
(Huyan Wooden Shed Arson Case)

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.320
(Qin Yu)

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.880
(Qin Yu)

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.560
Regarding Shi Zhi Yang's case...

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080
Thank you.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.320
It's what I should do.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.800
You presided over this case.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.640
You should know...

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.879
if Shi Zhi Yang is proven...

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.880
not to be a corrupt cop,

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.480
it also means...

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.240
retracting the previous killer's confession.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.240
Shi Zhi Yang's real killer is a woman.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.760
She has already been sentenced.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.960
But Han Gang's real killer...

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.840
hasn't been caught yet.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Our Regional Crime Unit...

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.040
will reopen the investigation.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.920
When you gave me the A05 statement,

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.600
did you expect this outcome?

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.680
This is a good thing.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.840
Maybe it's like you said before.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.080
This isn't the final result yet.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:43.920
Judge Qin.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.760
You helped the police force get rid of a bad apple.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.560
It has boosted their morale.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.399
A stable and prosperous society...

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.680
is good for economic development.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.360
There are no reporters here.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.080
Don't be so disgusting.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.720
Judge Qin, why do you say that?

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.959
I think our collaboration...

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.560
has been quite pleasant and successful.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.120
Judge Qin.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.360
You should remember...

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.079
that I'm on the committee...

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.320
of the Correctional Services Department.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.120
I just proposed to them...

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.959
to encourage inmates...

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.840
to be proactive and turn over a new leaf.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.280
We're setting up an incentive system...

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.360
that will be evaluated directly by our committee.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.960
If they behave well,

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.320
their sentences can be reduced,

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.640
and they can be released earlier.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:25.960
All right.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.080
I'll let you get back to work, Judge Qin.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.280
Goodbye.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.760
You've been presiding over a lot of big cases lately.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.880
You've lost weight again.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.040
It must be because you don't eat on time.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.119
Have you decided on the college Yi Wei will attend...

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.120
when he repeats his studies?

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.360
Should we apply in advance?

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.160
We don't have to do it so soon.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.960
Let him get out of prison and recover his health first.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.160
It's better to wait until the new semester...

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.480
to enroll.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.280
What if he gets out early?

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.120
Is that possible?

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.600
I heard about a new policy.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.040
If he behaves well, there's a chance.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.920
That's great.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.559
My Wei Wei is such a good boy.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.920
I'm sure he'll behave well.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.320
He'll definitely get out sooner.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.080
When we visit him next time,

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.120
let's encourage him.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.880
Here.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.880
Hurry up.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960
- Okay. - Eat more.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.360
Hey.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.799
If they really catch us,

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.800
what should we do?

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.440
It's okay even if they find it.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.120
They'll pretend they don't see it.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.320
Do you have to put it in my belongings every time?

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.239
Your dad is the Chief Justice...

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.080
who works for the big shots.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
What does that mean?

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280
Naive.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.680
Kid.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.919
In this world, it's either you exploit me,

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.960
or I exploit you.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.400
If it weren't for your dad,

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.680
would I be your friend?

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.520
Let me tell you.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.640
As long as your dad is obedient,

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.800
no one will touch you.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.560
Do you hear me?

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520
Don't be like this.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Eat it.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.200
All your worries will go away.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240
Go to sleep.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.800
(Building a community brings new hope)

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.119
Defend our homeland!

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.599
- Defend our homeland! - Defend our homeland!

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.719
We won't yield an inch!

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.039
- We won't yield an inch! - We won't yield an inch!

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.519
Defend our homeland!

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.839
- Defend our homeland! - Defend our homeland!

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.039
- We won't yield an inch! - We won't yield an inch!

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.759
- Defend our homeland! - Defend our homeland!

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.759
- We won't yield an inch! - We won't yield an inch!

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.119
- We won't yield an inch! - We won't yield an inch!

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.119
- We won't yield an inch! - We won't yield an inch!

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.640
Don't be like this.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.720
We agreed to negotiate.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800
Look at you now.

00:50:00.801 --> 00:50:01.840
How can we negotiate?

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.160
Granduncle is here.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.160
Granduncle! I'm glad you're here.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.440
Please talk to them.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.200
(Defend our homeland)

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.280
Defend our homeland!

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.599
- Defend our homeland! - Defend our homeland!

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.919
What do you think of this?

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.879
- Defend our homeland! - Defend our homeland!

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.200
There's trouble!

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.400
Da Niu is fighting with them.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.600
Take me to them!

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.840
Let's go.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.040
Their hunger strike has made the headlines.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.760
The public is starting to sympathize with them.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.599
As long as we meet the government's requirements...

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.600
of acquiring half the land...

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.360
before any fatalities occur,

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.600
it'll be fine.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.400
I'm just afraid...

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.160
that someone will end up dead...

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.840
before we meet the requirements.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.160
Don't worry.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.640
I've arranged everything.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.880
I always have a backup plan.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.400
Are the people you've arranged...

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.840
trustworthy?

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.640
I didn't arrange any people.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.200
I arranged profits.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.800
As long as there's profit involved,

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.160
people will be willing to do their best for you.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.680
We've already acquired this land.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.240
We have the right to seal it.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.640
Seal what?

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.319
He may have sold it, but I didn't!

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.559
How can you seal my land?

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.239
- Am I right? - Yes!

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.360
- We're not selling! - We're not selling!

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.600
- We're not selling! - We're not selling!

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.399
We're doing this legally!

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.039
Fence it off! Keep sealing it!

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.280
I don't care if it's legal.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.600
If you seal it,

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.600
we'll tear your fence down.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.040
This is our home.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.040
We're in charge!

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.120
Tear it down!

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.080
- Tear it down! - Tear it down!

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.680
- Tear it down! - Tear it down!

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.039
- Tear it down! - Don't do anything stupid!

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040
- Tear it down! - Tear it down!

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.040
- Tear it down! - Tear it down!

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.480
- Tear it down! - Tear it down!

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.320
Call an ambulance!

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.920
- Help! - What do we do?

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.080
- How did someone get stabbed? - Help!

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.600
Get out of the way.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.840
- What happened? - He stabbed him!
