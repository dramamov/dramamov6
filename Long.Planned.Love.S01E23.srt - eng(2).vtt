are you and Mr. Zhou in a relationship?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.400
Back then,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680
my brother died

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.430
did lent me a helping hand.

(Happy Daily)
But

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.430
there's no romance between us,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.750
just a sibling bond.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.160
I came back this time for his birthday

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.630
only as his little sister.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.920
As for

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.390
why I never came to Jiangyu before,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.360
it's because my brother died
in this city.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.040
I held a grudge against it.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.670
Who are you?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.190
Jian Wenqian,

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.240
about the Jian Cheng kidnapping case
5 years ago,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.480
please come with us

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.600
for investigation.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.430
Dad, I want to turn myself in.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.600
What are you doing?

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.000
Wenqian never even mentioned that.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.170
Why put yourself through this?

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.150
Everything started

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.040
because of me.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.150
In my whole life,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.680
I've never really decided anything.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.560
So this time,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.390
no matter how it ends,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.360
I want to face it on my own.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.790
Dad,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.040
if Mom asks about me,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.560
just tell her I'm on a work trip abroad.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.530
Say I'll be away for a few years.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.120
She overdosed on medication,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.560
which caused a miscarriage.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.800
Her body is very weak now.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.240
She needs proper care.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.680
And watch her emotional state.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.920
Thank you, doctor.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Didn't you say you'd take good care of her?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.160
She said she doesn't want those meds.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.560
Why are you still forcing her?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.510
How would I know
she's in such poor health?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.870
Back then, I took the same prescription.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.880
That's how I had you.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.000
Why can't she keep the baby like I could?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.800
If you ask me,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.600
she partied too much before.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.120
It wore her body out.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.390
Now she's too weak.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.160
That's why she lost the baby.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.390
It's not my fault.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.230
Mom.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120
Zhou Yufeng.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.200
Yawei.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.080
Don't move around.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.920
You need complete rest now.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.240
Zhou Yufeng.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.570
Our baby's gone.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.870
It was your mom who caused it.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.390
What do you mean I caused it?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.760
It was your weak health.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.000
Rural people tend to be frailer.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.800
Can't handle delicate matters.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.040
Wasting my medicine is one thing.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.600
You even caused the loss of my grandson.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.390
I'm too kind to hold it against you.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.240
Mom.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.350
Stop talking.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.150
Yawei needs peace.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.600
Can you head back first?

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.390
Yawei.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.790
I know you're heartbroken.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.200
But Mom meant well from the start.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.200
You can't put all the blame on her.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.960
Zhou Yufeng.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.200
Why didn't you listen to me?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.550
If you had told your mom back then,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.200
she wouldn't have forced me.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.030
Our child wouldn't have been gone.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.000
Zhou Yufeng.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.750
You're also the one to blame.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.440
Yawei.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.030
You're very weak right now.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.120
Try to rest for now.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.790
We'll talk about everything else later.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240
As for having children,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.200
in the future,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.550
there will be another chance.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.360
I'll get your medicine.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.200
Just rest for now.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360
(Zhou Yufeng,)

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.550
