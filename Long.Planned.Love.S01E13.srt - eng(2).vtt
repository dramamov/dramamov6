00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.550
Zhou Lu,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.190
I want Jian Cheng to have me
in her heart.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.360
Help me figure out a plan.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.950
It's Meng Tang's stuff first.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.740
And then it's yours.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130
Through all this, she never thought
to come to me.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.420
I, as her husband,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.340
feel like I'm just a decoration.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.420
Let me give you some advice?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.620
Uncle,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500
when did you start liking Cheng?

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.460
It's long planned.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.540
I've finally got her.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.880
Since the day I stepped
into the Zhou Family,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.780
I was placed under soft confinement
by Old Master Zhou,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.500
under the guise of protection.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.980
Only that little girl
chasing after Zhou Yufeng

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.620
would secretly offer me comfort
when passing by my door.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.500
She thought nobody ever noticed.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.670
Uncle Zhou.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.580
But she didn't know
I left the door open on purpose.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.500
Uncle Zhou!

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.340
Uncle Zhou, wake up.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.620
Uncle Zhou!

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.020
Uncle Zhou!

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.740
Uncle Zhou!

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.820
Uncle Zhou.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.580
Hang in there.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.260
I get you out of here.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.020
If Zhou Yufeng can treat her well,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.930
I can keep my distance from her.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.450
But now I've married her.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.010
I should be content.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.260
But I'm greedy too.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.180
I want to be in her heart.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.860
I want her to like me a little more.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.020
Cheng and Zhou Yufeng's bond

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.740
has been over 20 years.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.460
But so what?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.790
She was still trampled by him.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.740
So she is probably finding it hard

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.890
to believe in love now.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.350
And she won't fall for someone
so easily.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.500
That's why I come to you.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.860
You know her well.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.100
And you've got plenty of ideas.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.820
I do have a plan.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.620
Fight fire with fire.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.500
Let's hear it.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.370
Cheng's illness is caused by Zhou Yufeng.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.300
So if you want to help her heal,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.140
you'll have to start with Zhou Yufeng.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.540
Simply put,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.020
you step over Zhou Yufeng,

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.440
and go after her.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.860
What do you mean?

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.500
Step one,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.820
find a reason

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.000
to have her come to the office

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.550
to have lunch with you when she's free.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.700
I will create opportunities

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.740
for Zhou Yufeng to run into her
at the company.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.420
Are you helping me

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.660
or giving Yufeng a chance to back out?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.680
Never suspect the man you employ.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.300
Cheng's not like other women.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.100
Only by flipping the script,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.340
can you actually win her over.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.580
No.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.140
No.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.340
Stay back.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.300
Don't come closer.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.500
- No!
- Jian Cheng.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.060
Jian Cheng.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.140
Jian Cheng.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.880
- No!
- Wake up.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.850
No.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.470
- No.
- Jian Cheng.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.420
Don't be scared.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.900
No.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.030
Don't be scared.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.140
Don't be scared.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.180
I'm right here.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.180
It was just a dream.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.100
I'll always be here for you.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.380
Why not wear shoes?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.370
Breakfast will be ready soon.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.830
Let me take you upstairs
to put your shoes on.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.980
Thank you, Zhou Tingyan.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.260
Calling me honey

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.540
is better than saying thanks.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.290
Honey.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.660
I want to help you make breakfast.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.880
Alright, alright.

Fang,

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.240
can you teach me how to cook?

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.770
Ma'am, is my cooking not good enough?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.180
No.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.700
I just want to learn myself.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.970
I want to cook for my husband.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.250
Ma'am, cooking is actually quite easy.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.180
- Sorry.
- For example…

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.140
The person you are calling
is busy making money.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.980
Wait a sec.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.700
- Cheng.
- Yeah?

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.540
Are you busy?

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.380
Not now, but I will be soon. What's up?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.160
I think my uncle has someone else
outside.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.470
Ma'am, where are you going?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.330
To fix things.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.990
I want Jian Cheng to have me
in her heart.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.120
Help me figure out a plan.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.010
I do have a plan.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.030
Fight fire with fire.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.720
Why are you dressed like this today?

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.990
It's not your usual style.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.780
You don't understand.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.550
When there are lots of women around,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.700
I've got to stand out.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.500
But this is your workplace.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.660
I need to keep it elegant.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.470
My face really is just too good-looking.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.270
If I dress a bit more colorful,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.520
people think I'm just a pretty shell.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.480
Seriously.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.810
I've got both looks and depth.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.540
But what I wear doesn't really matter.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.190
What matters is that your uncle
likes it.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.830
This style of mine

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.620
is exactly his taste.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.500
Yeah.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.460
Yeah.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.620
Cheng,

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.660
let me give you a heads-up.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.300
Sometimes a guy likes a woman

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.740
not just for her looks or style.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.900
It's about the vibe.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.140
So what's her background exactly?

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.340
What does she do?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.300
How old is she?

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.420
Is she prettier than me?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.020
Her background?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.940
She's a major client of Qianyi Group.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.300
Speaking of beauty...

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.060
You're the most beautiful in my eyes.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.860
But

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.170
when it comes to my uncle,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.100
it's hard to say.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.740
I think my uncle treats her quite well.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.140
You have to see for yourself.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.020
(If I upset Qianyi's major client,)

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.760
(even if Zhou Tingyan doesn't get mad,)

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.990
(those major shareholders tied
to the group's interests)

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.780
(could drown me in criticism alone.)

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.060
(What did I do to deserve this?)

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.990
(My first love ran off
with his secretary.)

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.750
(My husband got targeted
by a major client.)

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.540
(Darn it!)

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.100
Let's go.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.260
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.020
Remember her.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.300
This is the boss's wife.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.300
From now on, let her through right away.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.500
Hello, Madam.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.700
My clueless younger brother

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.640
couldn't appreciate someone
as good as Meng Tang

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.240
insisting on his non-marriage ideology,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.890
and messing around outside.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.180
He even ran away from home.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.140
If you know where he is,

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.660
you have to tell me.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.260
Alright.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.100
What brings you here?

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.220
I…

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.490
Cheng brought you lunch.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.140
Yeah.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.990
I've got something urgent to handle.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.090
I won't join you for lunch.
I'm leaving first.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.060
(So Zhou Tingyan was supposed
to have lunch with that woman.)

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.260
Come with me.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.300
Inform Zhou Yufeng come over
in half an hour.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.620
Yes, sir.
