=Episode 6=

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.880
I heard that the mischievous daughter
of the Jian Family

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.790
has hurt her head.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.790
Now she lost her memory.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.070
No,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.960
she didn't.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960
That's memory confusion.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.960
She mistook Zhou Tingyan
for Zhou Yufeng.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.730
She thinks the one she loves
is Zhou Tingyan.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.070
Didn't the Zhou Family
to call off the engagement?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.310
Maybe she had a shock before.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.480
Then she fell again.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.790
But why did she only
forget Mr. Zhou Yufeng?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.690
Could she be pretending on purpose?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.960
Zhou Lu.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.980
(Zhou Lu, Jian Cheng's buddy)
About today's gathering,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.980
you didn't need to come.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.350
Going there will only make you a joke.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.840
Since they want to see the fun,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.790
let's give them one worth watching.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.790
Jian Cheng,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.440
how much longer are you going
to pretend?

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.270
Yufeng,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.690
don't you hate it the most
when Cheng keeps pestering you?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.350
Now she's forgotten you.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.000
Isn't this exactly what you want?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.910
This is between me and Jian Cheng.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.470
Step aside.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.310
Step aside.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.800
Don't get yourself involved.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.080
Looks like there's drama coming.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.920
Keep your voice down.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.270
Zhou Yufeng,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.840
about what happened between us,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.710
I've been hearing a lot lately.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.510
To sum it up,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.800
the two of us

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.000
grew up together.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.710
After we got engaged,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.920
you had an affair

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.460
with your secretary behind my back.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.150
Even knowing you'd changed
for the worse,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.000
I still clung to you desperately.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.150
In the end, I fell from a building,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.630
hit my head hard,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.480
and forget you.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.400
Right?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.120
Jian Cheng,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.590
stop pretending.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.590
I know you're not confused or lost.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.000
You're just trying to make me miserable.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.280
You haven't forgotten anyone,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.150
except for me.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.520
How is that even possible?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.000
Why not?

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.990
Why don't you try it too?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.710
Jump off a building.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.040
Make sure you get the pose right.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.430
Headfirst, of course.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.720
Judging by Jian Cheng's attitude,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.840
she doesn't love him at all.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.000
But Mr. Zhou seems

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.100
to still want to cling on.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.590
Come outside with me.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.310
I've been hearing way too much

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.240
about things between us lately.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.680
I know

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.240
I used to always cling to you.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.520
But now,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520
justice is on my side.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.430
I hit my head and forgot all about it.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.030
Now I don't pester you anymore.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.680
You can go marry your sweetheart.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.150
Didn't you already set a wedding date

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.810
with Jiang Yawei?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.400
Weren't you planning to marry her?

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.150
Then why are you still bothering me?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.820
Jian Cheng, have you lost it?
Jian Cheng.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.850
There are people watching.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.560
I thought it was Miss Jian
causing trouble.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.400
Turns out it's Mr. Zhou playing games.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
What a buzzkill.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.360
Let's go.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.430
Well said, Jian Cheng.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.160
- We work for the rich by day,
- Playboys should be punished.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.430
and enjoy the show they give us
at night.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.270
I heard Jiang Yawei

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.600
took advantage
when Jian Cheng was abroad.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.680
Trouble doesn't come without a reason.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.630
The guy's no saint either.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.480
Jian Cheng even supported Jiang Yawei.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.440
She's truly heartless,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.680
repaying kindness with betrayal.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.390
Zhou Lu's filming skills

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.740
are really impressive.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.530
Jian Cheng must've hit her head hard.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.830
(Could this whole thing)

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.040
(make Zhou Tingyan lose face?)

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.590
Hello?

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.870
Did you see the trending topic?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.670
Yeah, I saw it.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.860
Did I cause any trouble for you?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.450
No,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.840
you did great.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.840
As for what's next,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.710
I'll handle this.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.520
Yeah.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.190
I'll take care of the Jian Family
myself.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.150
Let's act separately.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.950
(Zhou Tingyan is really kind to me.)

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.070
Then till when,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.390
exactly?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.390
Isn't Zhou Yufeng planning
to marry Jiang Yawei?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.000
Let's wait until they get married.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.940
(Zhou Yufeng)
At 1:00 PM this afternoon,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.470
bring Jiang Yawei to the old residence.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.050
(1:00 PM)
It has already caused quite a stir.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.200
You're still pretending here.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.210
- You shameless woman!
- Mom!

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.400
- I didn't go to find you.
- Yawei.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.060
You actually showed up here yourself!

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.310
Mrs. Zhou,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.430
please let me explain.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.400
Explain what?!

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.780
What about the promise you made to me?

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.630
You told me you were leaving Yufeng.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.160
You made me believe you.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.230
From start to finish,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.310
it was all a lie.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.390
Mom!

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.630
You're still defending her?!

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.710
Mom...

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.190
- Step aside!
- Mom.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.190
I said move.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.030
Everyone's here.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.470
Yufeng,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.560
what's going on?

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.310
(Zhou Baichuan, Zhou Yufeng's father)

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.150
Dad.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.000
What happened here?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.310
My cousin brought his mistress

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.150
home.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.510
But it seems Auntie

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.510
doesn't like the daughter-in-law.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.950
And they ended up fighting.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.400
Zhou Lu,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.400
watch your words.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.970
I didn't say anything wrong.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.150
What?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.750
Dare to act but not admit?

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.830
Since the wedding date is set...

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.160
What wedding date?

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.390
There's no such thing.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.720
Jian Cheng made stuff up.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.560
Am I done talking yet?

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.510
I knew about this from the start.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.510
Yufeng told me.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.230
Well,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.830
it's still Jian Cheng's fault.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.190
She's the one who spread it.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.600
She's nothing but trouble.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.870
You were there that day.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.150
Tell me, was Jian Cheng wrong?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.470
No, she wasn't.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.050
My cousin arranged the gathering.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.170
There are security cameras in my club.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.030
Auntie,

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.470
want me to pull the footage for you?

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.390
Either way,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.510
Jian Cheng

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.170
humiliated Yufeng in front of everyone.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.270
She was in the wrong.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.470
If it wasn't for her,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.190
this mess wouldn't have happened.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.710
She's just relentless.

00:08:06.034 --> 00:08:07.234
Well,

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.630
don't be so fake.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.750
You all dislike Jian Cheng so much,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.190
always picking on her,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.130
and trying to shame her,

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.070
just because she once saved me.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.870
My father liked Baichuan the most.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.720
If I had died,

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.270
Qianyi would have gone to Baichuan.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.630
You blame Jian Cheng

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.200
for accidentally messing up your plans.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.800
But don't forget.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.890
As long as the eldest brother is here,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.750
you're not getting anything.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.390
Tingyan,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.960
no matter what, we're...

00:08:49.984 --> 00:08:50.716
Well,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.300
about how the eldest brother left,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.300
you need me to remind you?

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.720
Now everyone knows
they're getting married.

00:09:02.344 --> 00:09:03.044
Well,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.870
if you don't agree,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.870
why don't you teach me

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.260
how I should handle this?

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.350
Baichuan,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.500
what's your take on this?

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.400
I've always advocated
for freedom in marriage.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.670
Since it's Yufeng's choice,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.150
I'll respect him.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.750
Zhou Baichuan!

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.000
Yufeng and Jiang Yawei

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.270
aren't a good match.

00:09:48.694 --> 00:09:49.426
Well,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.000
I hope you think this through.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.390
If you want me to send Yufeng abroad,

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.630
we can do that.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.440
Once he's gone,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.790
the family won't have so much trouble.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.570
Everything will be calmer.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.870
Mom.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.990
Mom.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.840
Mom, I...

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.870
I agree.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.870
I agree they should get married.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.200
The trending topic blew up so much.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.700
It's normal for Dad and Mom to be mad.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.240
Cheng, you should come back and explain

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.510
and then apologize to them.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.630
The reason why I don't come back,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.030
don't tell me you don't know.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.870
It's all because of you.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.120
What's that got to do with me?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.000
Because

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.630
I like Zhou Tingyan.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.750
That must make you feel uneasy.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.660
Because you like Zhou Tingyan too.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.070
And you want to marry him.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.410
You and I

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.910
are rivals in love.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.600
Jian Cheng, what nonsense
are you talking?

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.150
I am not talking nonsense.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.630
Pan Yu told me.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.470
He said

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.270
you used work as an excuse

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.910
to secretly flirt with his boss.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.390
His boss

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.110
is already

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.470
tired of you.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.840
Wenqian,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.150
you really like Zhou Tingyan, huh?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.910
I've never heard you say that.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.790
No, mom.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.910
She dare not say it.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.390
Because Zhou Tingyan warned her

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.510
that if

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.580
she kept pestering him,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.870
he'd take over Jian's Changsheng.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.670
What?! Wenqian,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.030
don't be reckless.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.180
This is serious business.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.670
Don't go provoke Zhou Tingyan.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.870
Jian Cheng,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.790
you

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.750
come with me.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.250
Stop making trouble, will you?

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.600
Marrying Zhou Yufeng would
already be great for you.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.320
Zhou Tingyan is out of your league.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.390
Besides,

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.360
Zhou Yufeng

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.630
and that Jiang girl

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.120
are not married yet.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.150
Zhou Tingyan owes you
a life-saving favor.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.200
No matter if

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.390
you've totally lost your mind,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.480
listen to me and go ask Zhou Tingyan
for help.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.360
Jian,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.480
let's make a bet.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.320
A bet?

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.390
What kind of bet?

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.510
If I can marry Zhou Tingyan,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.870
you'll give me 9% of the company shares
as a dowry.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.750
9%?

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.600
If I give you 9% more,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.390
you'll hold 11% in total.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.390
Yeah.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.390
Your sister

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.390
puts in a lot of effort for the company.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.560
Yet she only has 10%.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.870
And you haven't contributed anything.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.910
You sure have a big appetite.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.600
Jian, if I marry Zhou Tingyan,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.630
that's worth more
than 9% of the company.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.590
Think about it.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.630
If you became Zhou Tingyan's
father-in-law,

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.390
you'd have every project
coming your way.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It sounds

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.630
you could actually marry Zhou Tingyan.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.270
Quit while you're ahead.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.510
I'm sparing your pride here.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.750
My wager

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.630
is Changhuai Road that Grandma left me.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.000
Chang… Changhuai Road?!

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.750
Let's have a chat.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.590
Mom,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.280
what did Cheng

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.870
whisper to you just now?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.630
You don't look too well.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240
You always say

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.360
I'm stirring up trouble.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.240
At least I'm openly going
after one person.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.390
But your adopted daughter

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.600
has her eyes set on someone outside,

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.120
while stirring up trouble at home.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.030
I really have to hand it to her.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120
Nothing.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.890
She said she wants
to marry Zhou Tingyan.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.630
That little girl

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.000
is always daydreaming.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.840
Just ignore her.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.510
(Wenqian and Youhui?)

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.630
