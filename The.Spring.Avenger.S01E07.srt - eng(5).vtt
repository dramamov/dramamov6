WEBVTT

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.080
That's not allowed.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.160
Since the day I took you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.120
from the orphanage,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.360
I told you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
we can only be siblings.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.680
Mr. Wang,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.680
is something wrong with your scale?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.340
I clearly bought 2 jin of meat,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.440
but when I got home

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.720
it was only 1.6 jin.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.520
Nonsense!

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.800
I've been working here for over a decade.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.080
I've always been fair with my prices

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.039
and honest with everyone.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.840
But it really was...

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.770
What do you mean?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.200
When I say it's 2 jin, it's 2 jin.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.960
Take it or

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.680
leave it.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.160
Fine,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
just my bad luck.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.280
Miss,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.960
what would you like?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.759
All my meat is fresh today.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.160
Give me 5 jin of lean meat.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.960
Sure thing!

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.479
Wait.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.520
I think lean meat is too dry.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560
Let me have some fatty meat instead.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.699
Think it through before you speak next time.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.720
Here.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.400
Student.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.000
Take this.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.810
Two eggs without green onions.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.079
Eat it while it's hot.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.640
Ma'am.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.640
I forgot to bring money.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.560
It's okay.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.640
It's on me.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.770
Hurry to school now.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.200
Thank you, ma'am.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.960
No problem.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.680
Mom.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.000
You've given away several already today.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.079
Not everyone forgot their money.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.120
You can't give freebies to everyone.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.920
It's fine.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.320
One good deed a day.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.480
Mom does this

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.240
to build good karma for you too.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.040
How many do you want?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.840
Just one.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.880
Listen up, everyone!

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.800
Their pancakes

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.960
are made with expired flour

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.040
and dead rats.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.170
Don't buy from them!

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.050
What nonsense are you talking?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.120
I'm telling you,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.720
pack up your stall and get lost!

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.120
Wherever you set up your stall,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.380
I'll follow you there.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.100
But I think it tastes pretty good.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.480
All weighed up.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.720
That's 104 yuan in total.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.840
Since it's your first time here,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.400
I'll round it down

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.280
and make it 100.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.160
I find the fatty meat too greasy.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.160
Let me have some ribs instead.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.840
You little brat!

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.000
You're just here to cause trouble, aren't you?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.800
What's wrong?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.160
Is it because everyone found out

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.200
you've been selling water-injected meat,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.560
so now you're afraid to sell to me?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.840
You're talking nonsense.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.500
Whether it's nonsense or not,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.760
let's find out.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.120
No wonder I've always felt

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.680
there was something wrong with their meat.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.760
So it's water-injected meat.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.560
Refund!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.760
Refund!

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.440
Yes, refund!

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.900
Refund!

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.720
You...

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.780
Who are you really?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.360
Mr. Wang, you certainly have a convenient memory.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.960
Don't you remember

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.480
there was once a pancake stand?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.440
Because it offered good quality at low prices,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.600
business was booming.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.530
But then you ruined it until we couldn't keep it open.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.160
So it's you.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.720
Back then, you caused my mother and me

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.050
to lose our livelihood.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.160
We almost couldn't survive.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.160
Now,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.040
it's your turn.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.740
You little brat. You're asking for trouble.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.920
How dare you mess with me?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.240
I swear

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.040
I'll take you down with me today.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640
Who's this now?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.080
I'll

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.280
deal with you too.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.120
I think you're the blind one here.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.000
Selling water-injected pork

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.280
and attacking whistleblowers.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.440
With these two charges combined,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.440
who knows how many years you'll get.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.280
I don't believe this.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.880
Thank you for providing this information.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.010
Please come with me.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.040
The hero rescue is over.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.680
Mr. Mu, you're still not letting go.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.010
Where are you taking me?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.960
Where do you live?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.020
I'll take you home.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.890
I almost forgot about that.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.440
A CEO like you who's never done manual labor

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.640
why would you come to a market like this?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.400
Don't tell me

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.520
you're following me.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.680
What?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.120
Now that you know you're not my target,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.380
you've become interested in me instead?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.040
I was just passing by and saw you,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040
so I thought I'd give you a ride home.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.980
But I don't want to go home.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.680
I smell terrible.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.560
Mr. Mu, if you're going to help,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.640
go all the way.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.760
Take me somewhere I can clean up.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.480
Mr. Mu,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.440
could you get me a towel?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.200
I've left the towel at your door.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.480
A modern gentleman of virtue

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200
who remains unmoved by temptation.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.760
Impressive.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.370
She has tried to seduce me multiple times.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.880
She seems to want to sabotage

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.080
the marriage arrangement between the Mu and Gu families.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.360
What exactly happened

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.920
between her and Gu Nian?

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.280
Hey, Mr. Mu,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.400
help me investigate someone.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.920
I want all her information

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.720
down to the smallest detail.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.760
Yes, Mr. Mu.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.000
Mr. Mu,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.280
thank you for

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.900
what you did today.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.180
It's no trouble at all.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.220
Are you hungry?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.240
Would you like something to eat?

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.800
I'm just happy that Mr. Mu let me clean up.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.460
That's already enough for me.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.000
How could I let Mr. Mu spend money on me?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.060
I'll head home now.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.480
Wait.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.570
It's windy outside.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.260
Be careful not to catch a cold.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.240
After I wash the clothes,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.930
I'll return them to you.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.880
Stop!

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.080
Don't hit my mom!

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.220
Ten years of preparation,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.080
over 3,000 days of planning.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.800
Gu Nian,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.250
I'll watch you reach the peak of your life,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.360
then drag you down to hell with my own hands.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.440
From now on,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.480
your life

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.680
will be nothing but pain and suffering.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.400
Sis.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.080
Where are you going?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.140
Qiushan's aunt is coming back today.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.360
I'm going to see her.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.280
Mu Yaqin?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.000
I thought you didn't like her.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.480
I don't like her.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.280
But that troublemaking shrew

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.240
could be useful to us.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.100
A weapon we can use.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.080
Auntie.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.170
Long time no see.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.400
Your demeanor has improved.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.920
With you as my example,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.880
even if I'm just copying you,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.800
I should have mastered it by now.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.860
Let's talk inside.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.760
Weiwei's piano skills have improved a lot.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.080
I heard she has a new teacher.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.960
With an aunt like you,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.370
who excels in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.760
Vivi's genes

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.400
are naturally much better

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.720
than ordinary people's.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.520
Auntie,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.120
this painting is for you.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.560
[Drunken Monk]

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.080
A work by Master Fu Baoshi.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.840
I know you like it,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.120
so I asked a friend

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.160
to bid for it at an auction.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.520
You have a good eye.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960
You've improved.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.480
That's because

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.720
I have such a great mentor and friend like you, Auntie.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.400
However,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.800
Weiwei

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.680
isn't so lucky.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.000
What do you mean by that?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.800
Weiwei

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.280
has a new tutor.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.560
Named

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.680
Jiang Chunyu.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.120
She...

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.570
Is she causing trouble?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.080
More than just trouble.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.920
She has evil intentions.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.120
Not only is she seducing Qiushan,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.560
but she's also sowing discord

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.120
and making Weiwei hate me.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.120
This new tutor won't do.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
She must be fired.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.200
Otherwise,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.680
she'll definitely be a bad influence on Vivi.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.880
Jiang Chunyu hasn't really done anything wrong,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.080
so it wouldn't be right to dismiss her without a proper reason.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.880
Besides,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.160
Vivi quite likes her.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.960
Ask her to see me in the study.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160
Hello, Mrs. Mu.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.360
To be Vivi's tutor,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.760
your aesthetic sense, taste, and skills

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.480
all need to be up to standard.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.680
This is a painting by Master Fu Baoshi.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.810
Come here and give me your assessment.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.840
If you can't even appreciate

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.480
these modern calligraphy and painting masterpieces,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.000
how can you teach our Weiwei?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.080
May I ask

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.060
where these paintings

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.240
came from?

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440
They were gifts.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.900
Jiang Chunyu, what are you doing?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.480
You truly have no class.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.720
How dare you tear such valuable paintings?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.380
Can you afford to pay for them?

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.920
Actually, not just the Drunken Monk painting,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.050
all these paintings

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.080
should be torn up.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.080
How vulgar.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.440
I'm not being vulgar.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.400
It's just that all these paintings

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.440
are fake.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.640
Fake?

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.530
That's impossible.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.920
Don't make such outrageous claims.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.880
Master Fu Baoshi's landscape paintings

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.210
are truly exceptional.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.840
The most essential aspect

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.160
is his skillful use of ink.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.820
Master Fu Baoshi was a master of ink techniques.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.720
Among them,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.640
he most commonly used oil-based ink,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.120
specifically lacquer smoke ink,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.680
which has a black color with purple undertones

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.560
and a luminous quality in the purple.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.960
But these works,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.880
though the ink blending looks proper

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.280
and has rich variations,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.080
are made

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.560
with copper oil ink.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.210
They're merely forgeries.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.930
It really is copper oil ink.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.570
How do you know all this?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.440
Just a hobby.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.640
Auntie.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.640
I must have been deceived.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.440
I'll go find them right away.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.480
I will definitely give you

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.080
an explanation.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.440
I heard from Qiushan that

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.360
Weiwei has become much more sensible lately.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.620
It's all thanks to you.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.440
From now on,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.170
I'll leave Weiwei in your care.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.440
Ms. Mu,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480
you're too kind.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.080
This is just my job.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.160
Well...

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.280
I'll go teach Weiwei now.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.000
Okay.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.560
He's already gone.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.120
Snap out of it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.800
Auntie.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.980
I know about your marriage

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.880
arrangement

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.940
with the Gu family.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.300
But from what I see now,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.440
Gu Nian likes to sow discord

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.880
and his character is questionable.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.160
You should reconsider this carefully.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.480
I understand.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.520
Since you're back this time,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.920
please stay a bit longer.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.420
Weiwei misses you so much.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.560
If you knew she missed me,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.980
why didn't you bring her abroad to see me?

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.880
I've been so busy.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.020
I didn't have time.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.260
Since your brother...

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.200
You've become like a different person,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.060
burying yourself in work all day.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.880
That incident

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.460
wasn't your fault.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.850
You still like to get others to do your dirty work.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.080
But I seem to know

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.240
the people around Mu Qiushan better than you do.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.040
You'll need to step up your game.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.160
Now

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.880
it's my turn to give you a surprise.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.920
If you see me suddenly appear at the Gu family home,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.480
how will you react?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.960
This Qimen black tea looks excellent.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.680
Mr. Gu.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.480
Mr. Gu.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.080
Mr. Gu.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.920
What's wrong?

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.020
Don't move around.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.680
Are you...

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.920
I have a medical license.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.760
I can help.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.360
Thank you so much.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.840
No need to thank me, sir.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.370
I can see you're a tea lover.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.520
However,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.120
your kidneys aren't in great condition.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.650
If you really can't resist,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.120
you could try

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.250
Junshan Silver Needle yellow tea.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.359
Most people

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.560
who hear about Junshan Silver Needle

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.760
think it's green tea.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.720
It seems

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.060
you know quite a lot about tea.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.520
I have

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.720
some premium tea leaves at home.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.300
If you're interested,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.300
you could come take a look.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:24.440
And

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.839
let me be your host.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.520
Thank you very much.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.880
Sure.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.640
Thanks to you,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.440
I'll get to broaden my horizons too.
