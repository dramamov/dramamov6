00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.790
Are you all right?

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.680
Why did only you come?

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.590
Where's Ming Yi?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.560
How is His Lordship?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.760
The Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop has been removed,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.800
but the netherbeast core inside him is leaking.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.470
He could lose his mind at any moment.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.360
Be careful.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.000
Ming Yi?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.380
- Ming Yi. - Ji Bozai.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.000
Ji Bozai.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.110
Ji Bozai.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.680
Wake up.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.590
What happened to him?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.560
His body and mind are weak.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.000
Even the nightmares he finally let go of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.470
have returned.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.800
Nightmares

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.930
about the Sunken Abyss?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.120
His Lordship once told me

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.310
that being poisoned there kept him alive,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.070
though at the time,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.390
he wished he'd died instead.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.920
Those miasmas and herbs

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.090
kept him alive.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.550
But it wasn't until he met Bo Yulan

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.950
that he was truly healed.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.880
It's all right.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.310
I'm here.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.740
You're safe now.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.330
It's all right.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.160
It's all right.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.400
You're safe now.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.550
You're awake.

Finally!

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.080
At Mu Qibai's instigation, Meng Yangqiu

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.200
poisoned me with a Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.800
Mu Qibai will probably come soon with his men

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.730
to pin the crime of raising netherbeasts

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.060
on me.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.700
Am I alive now

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.620
only because of you?

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.640
Buxiu went to Dragon Carp Terrace first

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.300
to stall them.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.210
Then I went to help.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.090
We're allies.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.890
Of course I'd protect you.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.910
Yesterday at Shouhua Academy,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.320
everyone said I was raising netherbeasts.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.230
Did you not suspect I might have

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.520
absorbed the netherbeast core for myself

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.600
instead of refining it?

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.960
So you really didn't.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.010
Earlier,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.080
did you also believe

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.780
I never plotted against Ming Xian?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.670
I trust you.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.840
You entered my Spirit Well, didn't you?

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.370
Yes.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.220
So you know everything?

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.720
Yes.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.550
I know you

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.740
hid the Golden Millet Dream in your Spirit Well.

Everyone

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.080
in the Six Realms covets it.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.060
You had a chance to take it.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.810
And I'm Ming Xian's greatest rival.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.400

Let me handle it.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.070
Immortal Situ, you rarely show enthusiasm for work,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.160
yet whenever it concerns Wugui Sea,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.550
you're always the first to arrive.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.590
Who exactly are you doing this for?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.800
Lord Hanfeng, what are you implying?

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.610
Investigation and law enforcement

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.500
are the duty of the Judgment Hall.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.040
No matter the case,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.870
I'm obligated to uncover the truth as soon as possible.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.320
You tried to frame my husband

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.040
with some caltrop,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.080
and you still dare to cause trouble at Wugui Sea today?

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.710
Since the day the sinner Hou Zhao turned himself in,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.080
I'd suspected

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.840
someone in Jixing Abyss was raising netherbeasts,

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.390
so I ordered a search.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.650
Little did I expect

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.510
Ji Bozai to be the culprit.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.110
Now, with solid evidence...

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.200
Solid evidence?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.310
Tell me,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.900
what exactly makes it solid?

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.200
After Meng Yangqiu gave Ji Bozai a Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.990
Ji Bozai started to emit netherbeast energy.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.590
Everyone at Shouhua Academy

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.200
saw it with their own eyes.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.750
- Yes. - Many people saw it.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.630
It's absolutely true.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.230
Yes.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.920
Do it!

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.990
Wait.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.910
Everyone knows

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.030
that those who raise netherbeasts

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.000
carry lingering netherbeast energy that never fades.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.630
So let's test him again.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.630
If no netherbeast energy is found this time,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.750
it will prove his innocence.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.240
This Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.870
was retrieved

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.120
from Shouhua Academy by the Judgment Hall after Ji Bozai left.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.150
Ming Yi,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.550
may I have the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.720
taken from Ji Bozai?

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.080
I can remove its power

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.480
so it won't detect anything.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.510
It disappeared when I took it off him.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.880
I couldn't keep it.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.440
Don't worry.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.080
I'll find a way

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.680
to prove Immortal Ji's innocence.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.520
Thank you.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.820
How can you prove

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.980
this Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop hasn't been tampered with?

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.870
Then examine it yourself, Lord Hanfeng.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.360
Anyone who raises netherbeasts

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.390
wouldn't dare touch it.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.320
Situ Ling is bluffing him.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.120
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.040
Immortal Situ, is this really

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.280
the same caltrop as before?

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.320
If it is,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.520
how can you hold it barehanded?

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.590
The caltrop can detect netherbeast energy,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.710
but it's harmless itself.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.040
Of course he can touch it.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.200
Really?

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.710
But Lord Hanfeng told me

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.520
it must never be touched directly,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.520
so...

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.440
- Meng Yangqiu! - What's happening to Meng Yangqiu?

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.040
Yeah.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:37.560
Meng Yangqiu!

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.350
Something's wrong.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.700
- Is his old illness acting up? - Meng Yangqiu.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.280
Meng Yangqiu.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.470
Yan Xiao,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.990
check on him quickly. What's going on?

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.470
He looks like he's dying.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.160
Hurry, see what's wrong.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.590
What's wrong with him?

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:58.350
Yes, hurry.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.400
Something's off.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.470
- Right. - He was fine just a moment ago.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.560
Meng Yangqiu.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.170
Lord Hanfeng, are you trying to kill him here

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.590
in my Wugui Sea?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.560
Kill him?

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.200
Bozai,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.110
what are you talking about?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.710
Ji Bozai has

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.200
netherbeast marks on his face!

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.520
He's tainted by netherbeasts!

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.800
If Lord Ji truly keeps netherbeasts

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800
and has been corrupted by them,

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.280
he would've lost his mind long ago

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.430
and fallen under their control.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.590
But look, he stands before us,

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.830
perfectly sane.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.280
What more proof do you need?

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.320
You want another test with the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.710
I'll do it myself.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.600
Immortal Ji dares to touch it barehanded.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.510
I don't think he keeps netherbeasts.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.720
That brat Situ Ling tricked me.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.270
This caltrop

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.510
can't detect anything.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.650
Just a petty trick.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.410
I saw right through it.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.960
It may be petty,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.120
but it's enough to expose you.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.960
How...?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.140
Your Lordship!

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.600
Lord Hanfeng has netherbeast marks too!

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.480
How could that be?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.030
Right.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.190
- How's that possible? - Has he...

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.120
Has he been raising netherbeasts?

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.630
Hard to say.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.920
I simply channeled the netherbeast energy

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.440
that was once forced into me back into the caltrop.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.150
Lord Hanfeng,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.480
you must be familiar with this technique, right?

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.960
The energy you injected

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.870
was a bit too strong,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.840
so I still need more time

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.720
to recover my appearance.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.600
Is this true?

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.320
Did Lord Hanfeng really do such a thing?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.390
He wouldn't stoop so low, right?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.790
Now you see.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.390
My husband never kept netherbeasts.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.670
The problem has always been that Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.240
Meng Yangqiu was tricked by Lord Hanfeng.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.670
In truth,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.620
Lord Hanfeng tampered with that caltrop

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.240
to frame me through Meng Yangqiu.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.240
I merely used his own trick

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.080
against him.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.270
If you do not believe me,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.240
I can go to the Judgment Hall with Lord Hanfeng

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.550
and settle this once and for all.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.550
Good idea.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.630
Yes.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.440
They should go.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.080
Do a test with another caltrop,

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.080
and all will be clear.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.840
Lord Hanfeng,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.320
do you not dare?

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.400
Then please, Lord Hanfeng and Immortal Ji,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.730
come with me to the Judgment Hall.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.000
I will uncover the truth

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.440
and find out whose body truly bears netherbeast energy.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.960
The Judgment Hall enforces the law impartially.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.960
Do you intend to defy it, Lord Hanfeng?

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.240
All the immortals are watching.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.670
It was me.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.510
I accidentally harmed Immortal Ji.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.790
This is the truth, Chief Situ.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.320
It's all my fault.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.550
His Lordship knows nothing.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.600
You tried to harm Ji Bozai?

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.000
Since Ji Bozai became an immortal,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.600
Jixing Abyss has seen many disturbances,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.720
so I wanted to test him with a caltrop.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.600
But that caltrop

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.960
belonged to the sinner Xun Ming.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.070
Xun Ming

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.640
probably tampered with it.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.720
My negligence caused this chaos.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.960
It has nothing to do with Lord Hanfeng.

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:10.720
Please punish me, Chief Situ.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.920
You didn't know Xun Ming tampered with it,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.640
yet you knew it couldn't be touched by hand?

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.430
All is my fault.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.510
Please punish me.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.120
Lord Hanfeng,

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.430
you really should be raising dogs.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.400
Otherwise, your talents are wasted.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.230
Surely you jest.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.710
I've failed in my duty.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.600
I raised these worthless "dogs"

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.320
who brought shame upon me.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.640
I failed to discipline them

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.270
and ended up causing harm

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.950
to your body and mind.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.190
Since he has confessed,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.030
Chief Situ, please investigate impartially and strictly.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.920
Of course.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.710
And don't forget Meng Yangqiu.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.080
He was the one who gave Bozai

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.640
the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.470
Bring him away.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.560
Now that the matter is settled,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.800
we will take our leave.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.930
- I knew Immortal Ji was innocent. - Yes, he's innocent.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.030
We are sorry, Immortal Ji.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.630
We misunderstood you before.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.150
We truly misunderstood you, Immortal Ji.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.560
Please, Lord Hanfeng,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.320
find the one who's been keeping netherbeasts

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.670
and tear them to pieces.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.830
Certainly.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.240
When that day comes,

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.590
I will invite you both to witness it.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.080
Great.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.040
Granny Xun.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:02.960
Yes.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.080
See them out.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.670
Please leave.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.190
They're finally gone.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.430
How did you suddenly think

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.240
to plant a caltrop with netherbeast energy

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.590
back onto Mu Qibai?

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.800
Situ Ling's plan

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.080
was simply to use a weakened caltrop

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.280
to solve the immediate problem.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.560
But those who wish to frame me

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.480
will always come up with new tricks.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.120
So

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.110
I muddied the waters.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.960
Then they would have no leverage against me.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.190
What's wrong?

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.800
I think the Graft Spell backfired.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.280
It reverses spiritual veins. Dangerous indeed.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.480
Let me take a look.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.040
I'm fine.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.670
I...

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.520
Mu Qibai just lost a round.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.590
He'll try to get back at you.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.390
Go and refine the netherbeast core.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.600
I will head back now.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.040
After some rest, I'll be fine.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.710
Be careful when you refine the netherbeast core.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.350
Yan Xiao,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.910
what are you doing here?

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.000
Shao Qun took all the blame.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.700
The Judgment Hall can only punish him according to the law,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.470
so I came to get you out.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.760
What's wrong?

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.520
Look at me now.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.910
You must be laughing at me inside.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.240
It's not that bad.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.950
Come on.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.430
But Yan Xiao,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.190
I really can't figure it out.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.830
What on earth is going on?

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.280
Ji Bozai is innocent.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.830
Lord Hanfeng's men tried to frame him.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.720
But why?

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.040
What does Lord Hanfeng even want?

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.830
And now,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.390
Tianji will never forgive me.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.670
How can I ever explain this to her?

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.430
Yangqiu,

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.870
how could Tianji possibly forgive you?

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.320
You and I

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.830
are both Lord Hanfeng's men.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.430
And anyone who serves Lord Hanfeng

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.910
is naturally Tianji's enemy.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.360
I am Lord Hanfeng's man?

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.150
Since when?

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.190
You have always been.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.040
Why?

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.720
I'm just distantly related to him.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.670
Tianji was close to him as a child

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.390
and often brought me along to play with him,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.000
so I got to know him too.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.320
Lord Hanfeng is just

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.870
a relative with an official title.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.800
Every time you had those meetings,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.800
pre-meetings, meetings within meetings, and whatnot,

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.590
I just happened to be included.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.870
How does that make me...?

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.870
I guess I really am his man.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.830
So that means you are too, right?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.000
Let's go.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.630
Oh, right!

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.320
You used to be just a guard.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.560
Lord Hanfeng helped you become a physician.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.520
No wonder Tianji never seemed happy to see you after that.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.200
Yangqiu,

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:23.540
maybe

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.710
you should learn to be a bit sharper.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.240
I'll never

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.190
go near Lord Hanfeng again.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.720
Yan Xiao,

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.280
you won't either, right?

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.720
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.390
When he tried to kill me,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.910
did he give you a signal?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.830
Did he tell you

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.430
to kill me?

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.560
I'm right this time, aren't I?

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.190
We're close like brothers.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.390
He ordered you to kill me.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.190
Isn't that enough to make you stop working for him?

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.760
Did it never occur to you

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.910
that I would have killed you?

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.430
Of course not.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:03.960
I know you well.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.280
Lord Hanfeng used to be kind,

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.080
but now he's cruel.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.800
Why would you want

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960
to keep serving him?

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.630
You want to become a physician?

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:13.830
What a joke!

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.190
What are you doing?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.280
Lord Hanfeng.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.710
You were all promoted by me.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.910
Is this

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.400
how you serve His Majesty?

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.320
By bullying a colleague?

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.750
Our apologies, Lord Hanfeng.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.120
Pick up his books for him.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.950
Yes.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.230
Remember,

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.470
from now on, no one is to bully Immortal Yan Xiao again.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:53.560
Understood.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.510
Lord Hanfeng,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:01.880
you know my name?

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.320
I remember the name and background

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.040
of every one of the 9,000 members

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.510
of Jixing Palace.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.360
Thank you for standing up for me.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.160
Even in your humble position,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.560
you remain diligent.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.880
If all of Jixing Abyss's young ones were like you,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.800
I would have no worries.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.560
From today onward, you have access

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.190
to the Langhuan Pavilion

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.510
to study medical texts.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.600
I hope that one day,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.160
you will become a physician.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.620
Lord Hanfeng...

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.670
My goal

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.400
is to make Jixing Abyss rise above oppression

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:43.990
and for its descendants

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.820
to live free from humiliation.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.510
You will be able

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.190
to walk that upward path,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.360
right?

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.640
I won't fail your expectations, Lord Hanfeng.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.120
Is there a reason why you have to serve him?

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.230
Why must there be a reason?

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.950
Yangqiu,

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.040
let me tell you the truth.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.360
I chose to serve Lord Hanfeng.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.880
I wanted to climb higher through his power.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.040
Why are you so surprised?

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.360
Meng Yangqiu,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.430
you come from a family of wine immortals.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.160
No matter what happens,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.690
you can still live comfortably in Jixing Palace as a casual immortal.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.320
But me?

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.190
I have no one to rely on.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.930
No one has the right to judge

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.000
how I choose to rise.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.270
Only those born to comfort and privilege

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.640
can afford to care about dignity.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.670
Let's go.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:46.720
Let's go.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.670
Yan Xiao,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.710
should I write a letter of apology to Tianji?

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.090
Shao Qun...

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:42.990
Greetings, Lord Hanfeng.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.470
It's time to find an opportunity

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.330
for His Majesty to take this.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.470
That won't be necessary, Lord Hanfeng.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.120
His Majesty is old

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.080
and frail.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:00.720
Even without intervention,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.920
he will not last long.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.750
This elm was my favorite.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.800
After it withered,

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.600
I tried many ways

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.710
to revive it.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.080
But its roots were too weak.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.640
No matter how carefully I tended to it,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.600
I could not bring it back to life.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.640
So why not uproot it,

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.320
bury it

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.450
with those other plants that can no longer grow,

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.610
and turn them into nourishment?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.760
Perhaps then it might live again

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.000
and one day grow into a towering tree

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.110
that shelters all beneath it.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.630
If you wish to save this elm,

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.280
I will return to study my medical texts.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.910
There may still be a cure.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.190
Even with your skill,

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.720
you cannot ease the pain I feel right now.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.910
Yan Xiao,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.390
the choice is yours now.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.870
Will you save one person today

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.800
or save millions in the future?

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.480
Immortal Ji,

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.210
the netherbeast core in you keeps leaking.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.050
You must refine it again as soon as possible.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.910
You forced your way out of seclusion,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.630
and after removing the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.190
your body has become dangerously weak.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.870
You're now even more vulnerable to the netherbeasts' temptation.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.870
You must hold fast to your heart

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.520
and not let them cloud your mind.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.960
Are you really going to refine us?

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.110
Ji Bozai,

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.150
I can grant you the greatest power in the world

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.760
and make you the strongest in all Six Realms!

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.240
Join us!

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.960
Stay off my bed. You shed.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.150
Ming Yi, you've been suppressing

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.910
the aftereffects all this time in order to save Buxiu.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.830
You are truly tough and heroic.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.640
I'm just lucky

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.800
Ji Bozai didn't notice.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.360
It actually took me an entire day

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.670
to treat the aftereffects.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.470
The more petals

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.070
this Grief Blossom loses, the worse it gets, huh?

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:15.910
So you do realize it.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:18.990
Ming Yi,

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.270
we do aim to destroy the netherbeast army,

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.600
but as you see, the situation now is...

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.840
I know.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.230
Time is running out.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:28.800
So, Twenty-Seven,

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.080
listen carefully.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.910
If something happens to me,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.270
you must sever our master-servant spiritpact in advance.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.840
At least one of us should survive.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.670
How heartless are you?

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.950
I treat you like family,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.270
and you treat me like a stray cat?

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.160
I'm just being reasonable here.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.370
Am I wrong

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.560
to say so?

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.080
I'm only talking about a possibility.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.190
That won't happen!

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.320
His Lordship is in seclusion refining the netherbeast core.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.190
Before leaving, he gave me a prescription

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.320
and told me to gather the herbs accordingly

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.040
and take care of you.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.960
Here.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.240
Wugui Sea is truly busy today.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.910
We have another visitor.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.910
Ming Yi, you used a lot of spiritual power yesterday.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.640
I brewed this Jade Dew Tonic for you.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:54.040
It will help.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.470
Thank you, Immortal Situ.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.310
From yesterday until now,

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.680
you have helped me twice.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.620
I really don't know how to repay you.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.480
If you are willing,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.830
repay me with your hand in marriage.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.190
I'm joking.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.580
I ask nothing in return

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.840
for what I do for you.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.560
Immortal Situ, I...

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.830
I only hope

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.250
that when you someday leave Ji Bozai,

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.520
you will remember to come to me.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.240
Immortal Situ,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.680
I'm not the person you think I am.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.030
Even if I were,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.030
you don't need to be so...

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:57.320
Ming Yi,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.550
I once lived

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.360
like a walking corpse,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.630
unable to see any hope.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.470
It was because I met you

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.910
that I made it this far.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.800
What you have done for me

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.720
matters far more than you realize.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.600
Well...

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.990
- This... - May I

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.550
keep this hairpin as a memento?

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:38.910
This is my...

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.030
Has Your Lordship found

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.200
any new leads in Wugui Sea?

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.800
Ji Bozai did create

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.280
a real Spirit Well

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.240
and hide the Golden Millet Dream inside it.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.320
Ming Yi must have

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.710
married Ji Bozai because of that,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.650
to form a heart imprint and share divine consciousness.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.430
So she also knows that the Golden Millet Dream is hidden in the Spirit Well?

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.150
She shares divine consciousness with Ji Bozai,

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.030
so why hasn't she

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.240
entered the Spirit Well

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.680
to take the antidote?

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.760
Given how cunning Ji Bozai is,

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.880
he must've hidden it somewhere even more secret.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.110
There is another possibility.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.680
She couldn't

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.070
bring herself to take it.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:56.070
Impossible.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.240
Only those who share divine consciousness

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.350
can enter each other's Spirit Wells.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.390
Your Lordship cannot reach the Golden Millet Dream for now.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.990
But that person already discovered your whereabouts.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.430
For your safety,

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.870
let me kill him.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:11.840
He once showed interest in me.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.950
If I offer myself,

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.950
he will drop his guard.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.070
Fuyue,

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.120
I don't need you to go that far for me.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:22.640
This is between him and me.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.350
Arrange a meeting with him for me tomorrow.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:25.240
Remember,

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.510
I will go see him myself.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:28.800
Not you.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.070
You returned empty-handed again

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.910
from raiding Wugui Sea.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.640
If Situ Ling hadn't interfered,

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.760
everything could've gone according to plan.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.560
The Situ family has always been loyal to me.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.720
I don't know what's with that youngest son of theirs,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.910
but he keeps sabotaging my plans.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.870
I've sent people to look into it.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.640
Enough!

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.390
How dull are you?

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.950
After all this,

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.240
do you still not realize whose side Situ Ling is on?

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.270
I

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.250
will deal with him myself.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.330
Understood.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.070
Although we didn't succeed this time,

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.670
the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.440
did serious damage to Ji Bozai.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.110
He must be retreating to seclusion now

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.560
to refine the netherbeast core again.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.710
If we can find his hiding place,

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.150
we can destroy him in one strike.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.150
Do you have a plan?

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.080
I do have one.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.980
You know too little about Ji Bozai,

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.940
which is why you keep making mistakes.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.750
Please instruct me, Your Lordship.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.440
Ji Bozai was gravely wounded yesterday.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.520
His companion beast should not have been able to counterattack.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.750
Yet his silver dragon

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.120
defeated you all.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.000
Do you know why?

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.680
Yesterday at your mansion,

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.480
I saw a woman with spiritual veins.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.790
She was the one who beat you.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.950
Ming Yi?

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.430
As I recall,

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.390
you know a soul-seizing technique

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.640
that can shatter a person's guard

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.750
and force them to tell the truth.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.520
You know what to do, right?

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.470
Tomorrow, make sure you draw Ji Bozai out.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.310
Flowers!

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:30.790
Take a look, miss.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.520
I like this one.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.270
- Take this one, then. - All right.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.200
Flowers! Have a look!

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.300
- I'll take this one. - Flowers!

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.560
Sure.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.230
Here.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.130
Thank you. Come back again.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.430
I never expected a mere dancer like you

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.310
to be so defiant.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:16.950
I only want you to casually

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.600
lure Ming Yi over.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.600
It's a simple thing.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:22.910
Why make yourself suffer so much?

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.000
In your dreams.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.960
Give it back to me!

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:50.540
Give it back!

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.750
What are you doing?

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.960
Lord Hanfeng.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.960
When Situ Ling came by yesterday,

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960
what did he say to you?

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:14.680
He said

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.720
to remember to come to him

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.560
if I left Ji Bozai.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:21.430
Twenty-Seven!

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.270
No way.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.000
That was a plain love confession!

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.160
How could you just

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.740
say that so calmly?

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.670
It's not like that.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.830
He used to be bullied by his older brothers.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.600
I took him to the Qingyun Tournament

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:35.640
to cheer him up.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.520
He's probably just grateful to me.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.960
If you ask me,

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.920
he's just

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.230
confusing gratitude with affection.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.320
He will

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.920
understand in a few years.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.640
Didn't you tell him you weren't Ming Xian?

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.230
Yet he keeps helping you

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.050
again and again.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.790
He's a stubborn kid.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.960
What if he can't move on?

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.160
Then I...

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.020
"Need to discuss something with you. Zhang Tai."

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.060
Fuyue,

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.170
[Moonlit Blossoms]

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.780
get people to get Chao Yu drunk,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.560
and I will handle the rest.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.920
My dear brother,

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.750
you don't really think

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.430
luring me here

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.920
with the Golden Millet Dream's whereabouts

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.710
gives you a chance to kill me, do you?

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:04.840
In your dreams!

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.190
Just like your lowborn mother,

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.710
you don't deserve to live in this world at all.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.190
"All is proceeding as planned.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.080
We await Your Lordship.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.710
Respectfully, Lord Hanfeng."

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.040
Do you remember

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.870
the day you stood against me

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.120
with Ming Yi?

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.640
One look,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.120
and I knew you liked her.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:39.830
Useless fool,

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.870
you actually fell for a married woman?

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:44.350
I will show you

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.230
what will happen

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.080
to the woman you love.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:50.830
Chao Yu,

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:53.160
what are you going to do?

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.040
If you lay a finger on her...

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.710
Just wait and see.
