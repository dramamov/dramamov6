Jiang Yawei is just too much.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.950
She actually pushed Cheng off

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.590
from such a high place.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.900
How is she doing now?

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.830
She hasn't woken up.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.470
When will you and Zhou Tingyan get here?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.550
Almost there.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.630
Meng Tang.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.680
Is Jian Cheng doing okay?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.150
You're not welcome.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.430
Get out.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.190
Meng Tang.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.560
I just came to check on her.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.760
How is Jian Cheng?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.350
After all,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.400
I feel responsible.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.040
It was you who pushed her down.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.590
Then you jumped down yourself.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.040
That's not true.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.970
It is...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.230
I did have her called out to meet me.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.510
But once I saw her,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.000
I only begged her.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.680
I wanted her to show mercy
and let me go.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.740
She refused.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.150
She even grabbed my chin

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.480
and threatened me.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.790
Told me to break up with Yufeng.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000
She got more and more worked up,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.480
then accidentally pushed me.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.840
Jiang Yawei.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.430
I don't believe
every single word you say.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.560
You better hope Cheng's fine.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.120
Otherwise,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.200
you'll face consequences.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.840
I'm not lying.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.070
Everything I said is true.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.350
I wronged Jian Cheng.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.190
She pushed me down the stairs,
but I don't blame her.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.710
I just want to make sure she's okay.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.120
Meng Tang.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560
Yawei came here

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.080
because she's kind-hearted.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.710
What Jian Cheng did to her
is against the law.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.630
Are you serious?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.470
Yufeng, has your brain stopped working?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.700
There is no CCTV.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.510
Whatever Yawei says,
you just believe it?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.710
You and Cheng grew up together.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.460
Don't you know
what kind of person she is?

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.150
You rather trust a homewrecker?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.200
What are you doing?

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.750
Yufeng, touch her again
and see what happens.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.910
I'm okay.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.030
Uncle Zhou.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.190
The doctor said Jian Cheng needs rest.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.750
Take your girl and get out.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.870
Let's go.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.270
Cheng, you're awake.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.840
Zhou.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.990
Zhou.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.240
Zhou Tingyan.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.990
Uncle Zhou.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.280
Zhou Tingyan.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.680
Give me a hug.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.240
(She's using Uncle Zhou like a helper.)

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.240
(Got some nerve.)

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.720
(This is bad.)

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.750
(Cheng must have)

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.590
(messed up her head.)

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.400
Is your head hurting?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.870
I'll go get the doctor.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.270
Don't go.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
My head's fine.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.430
Honey.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.120
This…

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.240
Yesterday,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.310
when I fell down,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.400
I was scared to death.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.040
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.310
Cheng.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.270
Maybe sleep a bit more?

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.350
Jian Cheng.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.430
You're playing dumb.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.560
What trick is it this time?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.000
You really think

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.600
this is getting under my skin?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.240
You called me honey.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.600
Does that mean we're married?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.720
No, we're not.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.040
But we are engaged.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.290
After New Year,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.950
we'll be getting married.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.600
Why are you asking me
such weird questions?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.510
Is this... memory loss?

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.510
Looks like a blessing in disguise.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.270
Jian Cheng.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.230
Stop pretending.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.870
You asked me to call off the engagement.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.830
So what is this act now?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.840
Uncle Zhou.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.750
She's using you just to get at me.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.590
Enough.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.510
You hit your head on the fall.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800
Get the doctor to check.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.270
All tests came back normal.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.270
She just needs rest.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.750
As for the memory confusion,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.900
it might just be temporary.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.870
Don't worry, it won't affect daily life.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.110
Doctor.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.470
She's pretending, right?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.070
How could such a thing even happen?

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.430
Beyond ridiculous.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.390
Jian Cheng, get up.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.250
Drop the act.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.150
Leave.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.630
She just woke up and needs peace.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.150
(Jian Cheng,)

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.870
(let's see how long you can keep this up.)

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.750
Let's head back.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.590
Come on.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.400
Cheng.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.190
Get some proper rest first.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.230
Mm.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.830
I'll check with the doctor.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.790
Be back in a bit.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.390
I hit my head pretty hard.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.750
You look pretty happy.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.870
Of course, I'm happy.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.390
You forgot about that jerk Zhou Yufeng.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.630
That's worth a bottle of wine
to celebrate.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.910
I didn't forget.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.950
You didn't?

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.070
Then what was that just now?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.190
I was acting.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.350
Come on.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.270
What's going on
between you and Jiang Yawei?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.750
She jumped on her own.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.510
Knew it.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.870
Definitely one of her dirty tricks.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.070
That way she doesn't have to apologize

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.610
and can throw the blame on you.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.750
That's just too much.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.600
I'll go find her.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.360
Don't go.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.040
- Let her be.
- Seriously?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.070
She's trying to ruin your reputation.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.950
You owe this one to Qin Zhuo
and Zhou Tingyan.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.000
Tingyan saw Jiang Yawei
lying next to you.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.630
He instantly told Qin Zhuo

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.070
to keep it under wraps.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.750
Otherwise, who knows
what rumors would spread.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.590
Anyway,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.630
you just focus on resting now.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.830
Don't worry about a thing.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.270
(Jian Wenqian)
(Jian Cheng)

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.510
(is playing dumb.)

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.950
(And Zhou Tingyan sealed off the news.)

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.830
(Last night's act was all for nothing.)

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.020
(Jian Wenqian)

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.230
How did it go?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.000
Cheng said

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.270
she missed a step and fell on her own.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.870
But I don't buy it.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.790
Jiang Yawei.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.950
You should be grateful.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.390
Cheng doesn't remember all of you.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.920
From now on,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.720
if you try any more dirty tricks,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.950
I'll crush your dream
of joining the wealthy elite.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.880
- I...
- I heard everything.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.140
I'll take care of the rest.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.920
Hey, Qin Zhuo.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.950
Cheng wants to keep the peace.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.800
She said she fell down on her own.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.630
Maybe we should just let it go.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.270
So she won't get upset later

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.920
and start an argument with them.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.400
Alright.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.520
Looks like

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.080
Jian Cheng is determined

to cut all ties with Zhou Yufeng.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.910
Meng Tang is passing on Cheng's message.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.550
Cheng can do

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.990
whatever she wants.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.510
But Little Princess seems stuck on you.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200
What do you plan to do?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.270
I gave her the chance

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.320
and made her cling to me.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.030
What?

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.840
I'm going to marry her.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.350

The doctor already told me.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.710
(No way.)

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.870
(How could I be exposed this fast?)

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.870
(Oh my gosh.)

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.240
