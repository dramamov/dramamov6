while he was alive or after death—

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.660
there's no conclusive proof.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.390
You

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.360
are too young.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.680
You oversimplified it.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.750
If all the evidence

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.720
were neatly

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.840
laid out in front of you,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.440
then what would we detectives
be needed for?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440
It could be handed straight over

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:35.640
to the prosecutor's office.

[Interrogation Room 1]

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.080
Didn't your mentor

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.320
ever tell you this?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.390
Some cases

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.640
can't be solely solved by logic—

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.770
they also require love.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.480
Love?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.600
I really didn't kill Bao Desheng.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.030
We know.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.790
You know?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.360
You caught the murderer?

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.650
Ni Xiangdong killed Bao Desheng.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.270
Who?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.320
Ni Xiangdong?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.360
He killed Bao Desheng?

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.260
All these years,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.390
The Nanyang police have only

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.450
been investigating you as a suspect.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.090
Ni Xiangdong...

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.260
killed Bao Desheng?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.790
What have I been doing all these years?

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.080
Really?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.550
How did you find that out?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.250
Wu Ximei has confessed.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.750
Wu Ximei?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.200
Wu Ximei is still alive?

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.630
Well, God...

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.200
really likes

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.800
toying with people like us.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.140
If Ni Xiangdong

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.650
hadn't killed Bao Desheng,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.970
I wouldn't have had to run.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.200
If I hadn't run,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.490
things wouldn't have come to this.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.580
But heaven brought...

back in front of me.

Cao Xiaojun,

Wu Ximei,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.110
and me—

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600
we got tied together all over again.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.320
We met someone today.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.410
You probably can't guess who.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.190
Tian Baozhen.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.910
Look at this watch.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.470
This watch has special meaning.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.570
She hoped that

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.550
you would always wear it

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.750
and take good care of it.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.510
But you ended up

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.670
putting it on a dead man's wrist—

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.800
and on the wrong way.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.000
You met her?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.790
Where is she?

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.450
She's in

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.080
Weihai.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.800
We just talked to her today.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.050
She told us a lot

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.840
about you.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.390
She firmly believes you're a good person.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.240
She's even willing

00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.970
to go to court

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.270
to clear your name

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.500
in Bao Desheng's case.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.580
Xu Qingli,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.330
you've wandered

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.490
from south to north.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.510
When you arrived in Weihai,

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.720
she was right there.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.630
Surprised?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.890
She really wants to see you.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.030
But according to regulations,

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.720
she can't.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.550
However, she left you a letter.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.000
I don't want to read her letter.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.050
It's been so many years.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.100
It's all in the past.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.180
No, it's not.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.800
I firmly believe

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.640
it's not over in your heart.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.730
We've visited many people—

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.530
your coworkers,

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.600
your friends.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.000
Of course, you don't have many friends.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.270
Their assessments of you

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.530
were very consistent—

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:07.840
kind,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.080
upright,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.670
warm-hearted.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.310
They don't believe

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.980
Xu Qingli is a murderer.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.840
They always think

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.330
Xu Qingli is a good person,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.480
a very, very good person.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.000
We're also willing to believe

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.840
after you get your new identity,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.600
you'll want to start over

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.920
and be a good person.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.240
A good person?

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.090
What's the use of being a good person?

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.030
We also visited

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120
your hometown.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.000
We went to your village.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:56.890
And we met your father.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.480
Why did you go to my home?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.400
Why did you go to my home?

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.400
It's my business.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.790
Why did you bother my dad?

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.000
Your dad is getting old.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.720
He has cataracts.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.560
He can't see clearly.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.840
His legs aren't working well either.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.700
He can't do most of the heavy work.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.460
When your father met with us,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.360
he kept repeating one thing:

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.040
"Our Qingli is a good boy.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.610
He would never kill anyone."

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.970
As the police were leaving,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.670
he even stopped them

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.000
and knelt before them,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.030
begging them

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.840
to clear your name.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.280
If I saw my father like that,

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:12.960
I would feel terrible too.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.980
I promise you,

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.640
if you cooperate,

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.380
we'll clear your name.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.510
I'll personally call your father

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.670
and tell him

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.619
you didn't kill Bao Desheng,

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.160
so he can live out

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.520
his remaining years with dignity.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.140
While we were in your village,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.120
several of your students

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.930
came to see us.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440
They love you.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.070
They need Mr. Xu.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.290
But for love, Mr. Xu...

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.390
left them.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:07.770
He abandoned them.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.330
In the children's eyes,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.160
you are a good teacher.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.410
Even now,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.510
they still believe

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.830
there's no one better than Mr. Xu.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.550
Mr. Xu is a good man.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.540
How could Mr. Xu possibly kill someone?

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.300
How could Mr. Xu possibly kill someone?

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.970
How could Mr. Xu

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.240
be a murderer?

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.180
You have let your students down.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.850
You've betrayed

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.440
their love

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.200
and trust.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.370
And more importantly,
you have let your father down.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.650
Does this painting

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.610
look familiar?

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.160
It was painted by Cao Tianbao,
who depends on you most.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.440
He sees you as family.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.120
What did you do to him?

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.460
You killed his father.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.610
Was this how you show your love for him?

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.640
You even tried to kill his mother.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.240
If

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.960
Officer Meng Zhao from our precinct

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.200
hadn't gone up on the scaffold
in place of her,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:25.890
this child

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.070
would have lost both his parents
in a single day

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.270
and become an orphan.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.920
How will you

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.780
face your students in the future?

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.180
When your father

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:36.880
asks you about this,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.210
how will you answer him?

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:38.970
Enough.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.350
Say no more.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.350
You were once a teacher.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.700
You don't look like

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.920
a teacher at all.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.270
You have no sense of responsibility,

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.750
yet you taught your students

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.750
to be good people.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.400
You're afraid to face the truth.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.160
Yes.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.830
You're afraid to face the police.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:53.550
Yes, I am.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.640
If you had even a little faith

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.830
in us police officers,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.920
you wouldn't have

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.070
ended up here today.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.010
What about that kid?

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.680
face his life?

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.350

It's just that...

Wu Ximei committed murder

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.290

for Uncle Caizeng.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:43.980
I won't go see him myself.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.440

neither of us was ever home.

Even when we finally had time off,

either your team needed you

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.130
