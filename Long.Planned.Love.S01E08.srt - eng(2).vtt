Zhou Tingyan said

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.160
he wants me to move
into the wedding apartment.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.260
Do you want to move in?

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.700
Of course.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.620
You two are alone together in one room.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.420
If he wants to do something,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.780
will you agree or not?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.460
Of course I will agree.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.890
We've already got the certificates.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.360
It's bound to happen sooner or later.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.420
No need to be overly resistant.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.590
♪Return to silence♪

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.140
But still,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.340
in just three months,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.980
you've changed partners,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.380
got married,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.580
moved in together,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.020
and it won't be long

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.220
before you have a baby.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.660
Honestly, comparisons are
truly infuriating.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.380
I

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.500
am still only engaged.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.020
So how are you and Qin Zhuo lately?

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.500
No real progress.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.260
Lately,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.300
he heard I've been getting closer
to his mom.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.460
Now he doesn't even dare
to return to the Qin Family.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.500
I honestly don't know what to do.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.980
Tang,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.390
Zhou Tingyan said he's arranged
a gathering this afternoon.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.220
He wants me to meet some of his friends.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.220
Qin Zhuo will definitely be there too.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.220
Do you want to go?

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.740
I'd like to.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.700
But,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.300
I...

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.660
Not sure if it's the right place for me.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.940
Don't overthink it.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.100
Just make sure you dress up nicely.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.660
Forget about everything else.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.980
OK?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.410
OK.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.730
(Zhou Tingyan)
Zhou Tingyan,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.660
are you busy?

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.820
Sorry.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.060
The person you're calling
is busy making money.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.900
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.860
Send one even if it's...

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.220
I'm not busy.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.300
Well…

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.820
it's just…

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.620
I am shy.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.820
If I meet your friends alone,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.820
I'll get really nervous.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.020
Can I

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.720
bring Tang along?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.320
Is this because of Qin Zhuo?

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.060
Yeah.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.460
Tang wants to see Qin Zhuo.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.900
But Qin Zhuo keeps avoiding her.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.530
If Meng Tang comes,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.130
Qin Zhuo might not show up.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.380
Zhou Tingyan,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.860
can you help me?

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.460
Can you arrange for them
to meet outside?

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.660
Just once.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.340
Alright.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.900
I'll arrange

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.980
for them to meet.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.420
Zhou Tingyan, you're really amazing.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.460
I'll go shopping with Tang
and buy some gifts.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.620
After that, I'll head straight over.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.740
I won't pack my luggage for now.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.870
Let's move tomorrow.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.020
Wait a sec.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.690
How about we go to the wedding apartment
after dinner tonight?

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.820
I can help you pack tomorrow.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.060
Does it have to be tonight?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.620
Can't we delay it for one day?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.340
Let's go tonight, OK?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.700
Jian Cheng.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.220
(Could it be)

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.060
(he actually wants to...)

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.740
How about this?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.590
After dinner, come back with me first.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.420
I'll drop you back later.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.880
That might not work.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.220
Tang will probably cry tonight.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.130
I need to be with her.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.180
Just half an hour.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.460
I'll bring you back after that.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.320
(Oh no.)

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.090
(Zhou Tingyan definitely
has plans tonight).

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.790
How about ten minutes?

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.740
Five minutes, deal?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.780
Not a second less.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.980
I'll finish quickly.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.220
Then I'll take you back.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.020
(Five minutes?)

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.860
(That fast?)

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.650
He agreed. He'll let you meet him.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.620
Here you are.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.860
Yeah.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.020
(He should be healthy.)

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.860
(Why only five minutes?)

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.260
Cheng,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.750
what are you looking at?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.520
I'm just going to the restroom.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.980
Take Tang to meet Qin Zhuo first.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.060
Alright.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.500
Let's go.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.500
Yeah.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.260
Meng Tang.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.140
Meng Tang,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.530
can you stop making a scene?

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.500
Let go of me.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.500
Release me.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.940
Cheng.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.580
What happened?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.360
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.460
I don't apologize.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.260
It's fine.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.140
You didn't do wrong. You don't need to.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.100
Yeah.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.290
Zhou Tingyan told me to wait
for Qin Zhuo in the private room.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.700
But unexpectedly,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.660
it was Mi Shan who showed up.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.900
(Mi Shan?)

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.260
What did she say?

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.380
This restaurant

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.180
was acquired for her by Qin Zhuo
with his money.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.100
She said she was afraid
I'd be upset and confront him.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.740
Then,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.890
she insisted on giving the money
back to me.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.660
How ridiculous!

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.660
I didn't even know anything about it.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.500
And then she added,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.420
Qin Zhuo

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.980
has always only given to her

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.300
without asking for anything in return.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.860
She even showed me a photo
of them kissing on a trip.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.890
Cheng,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.740
my engagement with him
hasn't even ended.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.660
So why did he kiss another woman?

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.900
He must really hate me.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.640
What's going on with Qin Zhuo?

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.180
When Qin Zhuo showed up...

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.860
Meng Tang, Meng Tang.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.900
I was too abrupt just now.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.290
Please don't be mad at me, OK?

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.770
Let me go.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.060
Meng Tang, Meng Tang.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.020
Meng Tang, I'm sorry.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.700
Meng Tang.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.900
What are you doing?

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.100
What do you mean?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.540
I didn't do anything.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.140
I saw it. Why did you push her?

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.740
Apologize to her.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.100
Why should I apologize?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.330
I'm asking you to apologize.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.780
Why should I apologize?

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.040
It's not even my fault.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.460
Don't be scared.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.290
Mi Shan really loves to act.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.650
Lately, you know,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.030
I've been pretty into acting too.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.370
I'm gonna go match her skills for a bit.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.620
What's up?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.180
Looking at you like this,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.520
I feel bad hitting you.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.610
But I still give you a couple punches.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.330
Otherwise, I can't explain
to Jian Cheng.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.990
Putting romance over friendship.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.970
Who are you talking about?

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.940
If I'd known this was your ex's
restaurant,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.940
I wouldn't have come.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.300
I only knew it was run by Mi Shan,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.660
but I came here to eat

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.940
just because the food's great.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.600
Are there no good restaurants
in the whole Jiangyu?

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.990
Mi Shan said she wouldn't be in Jiangyu
these days.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.440
I didn't expect to run into her.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.260
Don't tell me

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.490
you haven't completely cut ties
with Mi Shan.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.970
No way.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.320
Before Meng Tang,
couldn't I date anyone?

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.500
I'm not like you,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.500
32 already,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.100
still saving the first kiss.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.780
Who says that?

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.640
Jian Cheng kissed me yesterday.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.600
You got your first kiss at 32.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.860
That's something to brag about?

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.220
Anyway, after Mi Shan and I broke up,

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.820
we made a clean cut.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.420
We still kept in touch,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.420
but only as friends.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.180
After I got engaged to Meng Tang,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.990
I stayed completely clean outside,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.650
and never touched another woman.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.580
As for Mi Shan,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.540
I owe her.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.460
So I have to take care of her.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.860
What about Meng Tang?

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.420
What are you going to do?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.960
Meng Tang's really good.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.640
Honestly, I don't dislike her that much.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.900
I don't want to hurt her.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.380
You asked me to explain it
to her clearly,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.540
so I came.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.580
I didn't expect Mi Shan to show up.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.990
I don't know how important
Mi Shan is to Qin Zhuo.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.590
(Honey)
But I can't allow her to bully Tang.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.800
Let me give you a quick update.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.540
I'm heading over to confront Mi Shan.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.720
You won't be able to stop me.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.640
Unless you knock me out
and drag me away.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.500
Zhou Tingyan,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.170
this gathering was arranged
by you today.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.400
If you don't know

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.860
that Mi Shan is the restaurant owner,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.600
I won't blame you.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.060
But if you knew ahead of time,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.540
I would ignore you for a month.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.940
Because I'm really upset.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.280
I don't want to talk to you.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.540
If you're on my side,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.060
come over in 30 minutes.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.020
If you're siding with Qin Zhuo,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.860
then I start to ignore you tonight.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.180
Sorry, buddy.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.020
What are you doing?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.780
You forget me due to a woman.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.620
So despicable!

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.020
Long time no see.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.900
Do you remember me, Mi Shan?

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.500
Miss Jian, it's been a while.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.700
Right now,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.870
I'm married to Zhou Tingyan.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.420
You should call me Mrs. Zhou.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.380
Mrs. Zhou.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.140
Yeah.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.020
You bullied Tang

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.060
in this place?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.640
What are you talking about?

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.300
The security cameras here

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.820
don't work today, do they?

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.880
What are you trying to do?

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.580
I've seen these little tricks

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.660
back in high school.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.300
If you dare to bully Tang again,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.740
I'll make you regret it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.890
Handle your own affairs

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.020
yourselves.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.780
Jian Cheng.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.660
Honey.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.620
Qin Zhuo.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.500
Cheng.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.060
Be careful.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.620
How is it?

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.380
Here.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.140
Here. Here.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.260
My head hurts.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.140
My shoulder hurts.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.180
My stomach hurts too.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.420
And my legs.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.190
- My whole body hurts.
- What happened?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.610
She was the one who pushed me first.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.280
The moment you showed up, she collapsed.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.020
I…

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.140
Still covering for her, huh?

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.460
It really hurts.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.630
Let's hear their side first.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.220
- Let me talk.
- Stop that.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.790
Treat the wound first.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.780
Wait a sec.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.060
Just a few words.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.180
Only a few words.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.700
Be good. Listen to me.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.970
Zhou Tingyan, if you promise me now,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.140
you can do whatever you want

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.390
at home tonight.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.020
Qin Zhuo,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.700
did you go on a trip with Mi Shan

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.320
during the New Year holiday?

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.290
She showed me the photo of your trip,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.990
in which you were hugging and kissing.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.020
What photo?

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.380
I have no idea.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.940
I didn't show her any photo.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.780
You must have it in your phone.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.320
If not, then you deleted it.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.660
Deleting it won't change a thing.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.640
It's already in my head.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.740
In the photo,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.300
you were wearing

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.060
a gray hiking jacket,

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.660
black pants and black shoes.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.660
Mi Shan was in a blue tracksuit.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.420
Mi Shan?

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.260
I heard

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.940
this restaurant's theme

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:26.780
is love.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.500
So it turns out

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.380
Miss Mi's so‑called love

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.300
is gained by destroying others'
relationship.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:37.900
Jian Chen,

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.060
I didn't handle this matter well.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.440
I apologize to you for her.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.420
Honey,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.300
this restaurant's values are skewed.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.320
Ours are solid.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.220
Let's go.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.030
Tang, come on.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.060
It's not like that, Qin Zhuo.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.060
Please hear me out.
