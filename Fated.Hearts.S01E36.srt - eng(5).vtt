[Episode 36]

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.200
This is all because of you,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.039
Mother!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.450
I know

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.710
you let Xia Jingshi go

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770
because you were afraid I'd kill him.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.200
But I'll say it againâ€”

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.430
he may look like a beaten dog,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.030
but he's actually a wolf cub!

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.690
Sooner or later, he will bite!

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.430
You're the one who's been deceived,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.150
Mother!

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.079
Emperor, you are the ruler of this nation.

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.490
If you want to strip him
of his military power,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.890
I won't stand in your way.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.630
But you must wait until
after the Qianqiu Festival.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.079
Every year during the festival,

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:42.840
those old generals

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.870
come to the capital,
as tradition dictates.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.670
I will personally appease them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.130
After the festival,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.290
whatever you wish to do,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.280
I will not interfere.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.160
Do you mean it?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.840
I do.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.770
Then it's a deal.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.040
[Serene Abode]

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.450
Your Highness,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.310
our troops

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.150
have departed Pingling City

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.630
and are heading to the capital.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.630
Send word to themâ€”

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.140
they must move in secrecy.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.560
Anyone who discovers them along the way

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.560
must be silenced.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.280
Yes!

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:58.960
Your Majesty,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400
the Ministry of Rites
has received a letter

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.600
from Susha.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.710
It's addressed to

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.370
Princess Xiyang of Susha.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.640
Let me see it.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.530
[To Feng Xiyang]

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.020
Your Highness,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.160
isn't Xia Jingyan the emperor?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.870
The palace has every medicine imaginable.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.730
Why go to all this trouble for him?

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.530
Since I need his help,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.560
I should naturally show sincerity.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.680
Besides, Xia Jingyan is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.950
temperamental and unpredictable.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.010
I can't figure out what's on his mind.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.190
I'm just afraid
he might suddenly change his mind

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.390
and refuse to help me.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.730
In any case,

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.730
keeping him pleased for now

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.510
can't hurt.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.720
Why grind up these perfectly

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.560
good flowers?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.350
They're Chinese roses.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.870
I searched the entire Flower Hall

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.270
to gather just these few.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.070
With so many rare and exotic flowers,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.020
you only prefer

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.870
those

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.850
that look common.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.780
What do you know?

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.950
Applying crushed Chinese roses externally

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.120
can promote blood circulation,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.920
reduce swelling, and ease pain.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.750
You're hurt?

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.210
It's for you.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.680
Didn't you strain your arm

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.010
by dry-firing your bow?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.860
So you do care about me.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.670
Don't flatter yourself.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.750
I'm the type of person

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.270
who would help

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.730
even injured cats and dogs

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.000
if I came across them.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.480
Don't read too much into it.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.800
There's a letter for you.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.730
I wasn't planning to give it to you.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.690
But for the sake of this rose ointment,

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.480
[To Feng Xiyang]

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.360
I'll let you read it.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.290
What does it say?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.750
Your brother might still be alive.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.190
This letter

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.310
might be from him.

[To Feng Xiyang]

We don't know who sent the letter.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.330
It may be a forgery.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.920
Perhaps

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920
some fool wrote it

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.810

I knew it.

I knew my brother

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.270
would never abandon me.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.130
Your Majesty, are you feeling unwell?

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.270
I don't know why,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.430
but a strange sense of unease
came over me.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.830
Should we call for the imperial physician?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.950
His Majesty has arrived!

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.000
Didn't I tell you to

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.270
reflect on your actions in Yinghua Palace?

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.800
What are you all good for?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.270
I ordered you

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.730
to watch over His Majesty.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.250
Who dares to stop me?

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.690
I'm in no mood to argue with you today.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.360
Go back and rest.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.750
I didn't come to argue.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.280
I came for the Imperial Seal.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.070
The Keeper of the Imperial Seal said

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.670
the seal is with you, Mother.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.510
What do you need the seal for?

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.170
I am the ruler of this country.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.630
What's wrong with me using the seal?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.560
Very well.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.480
You are the ruler of this country.

So you still remember I'm your mother?

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.190
I'm going to issue an edict

of their command over the Imperial Guards.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.750
Empress Dowager, I request that...

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.670
you hand over the Imperial Seal.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.750

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.920
in front of others,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.820
you should behave more appropriately.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.679
Jinwu Guards,

Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.610
I ask you,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.780
who do the Jinwu Guards serve?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.040
Your Majesty,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.390
the Jinwu Guards serve as
the emperor's personal guards.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.790
They take orders directly from the emperor

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.550
and are responsible for
protecting the imperial residences

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.360
and ensuring the safety
of the imperial family.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.690
"Take orders directly from the emperor."

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.270
What do these words mean?

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.790
I'm asking you a question!

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.790
Whose approval are you waiting for?

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.720
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.380
Chengyang!

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.250
Stop this nonsense!

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.660
As I've said,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.440
I am the Emperor.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.480
This imperial palace,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.540
all of Yujing City,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.790
and even the entire Susha

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.990
are under my command.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.150
You palace guardsâ€”

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.600
if you cannot follow my orders,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.290
then you need not serve any longer.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.760
This subject

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.660
is at Your Majesty's command!

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.800
All of you, leave us.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.790
I have something to say to His Majesty.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.980
All of you, out.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.500
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.600
Have you lost your mind?

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.960
In front of all those people,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.030
what are you trying to do?

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.490
Are you attempting a coup?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.350
You asked me to reflect,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.220
and I've realized only one thingâ€”

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.870
I no longer wish to play

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.020
the emperor.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.720
And the last thing I will do

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.320
as this puppet emperor

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.600
is reclaim military power

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.150
and clear the obstacles for my brother

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.320
so he can eliminate
Murong Zhong and his son

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.240
without concern for future troubles!

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.640
You...

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.810
My mind is made up.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.850
If you refuse to hand over
the Imperial Seal,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.080
I'll summon all the court officials

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.970
and publicly announce the removal
of their military command.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.720
Guards!

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.180
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.670
Convey my decree:

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.870
Strip the Commandery Prince of Yishu,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.660
Murong Yao,

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.600
of his command

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.390
over the Imperial Guards immediately.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.600
All Imperial Guards

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.760
shall obey only my commands.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080
Those who disobey

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.720
shall be executed.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.840
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.720
By the mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor of Susha

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.480
decrees:

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.030
The Commandery Prince of Yishu,
Murong Yao,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.670
is hereby ordered to
return home immediately and rest.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.320
The position of Commander
of the Imperial Guards

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.030
shall be filled
by another worthy candidate.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.200
By imperial order.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.100
Your Lordship.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.250
Quickly accept the decree.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.000
This subject

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.640
accepts the decree.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.030
Prepare the carriage.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.200
I'm going into the palace.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.530
When my father returns,

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.750
tell him I've gone to see
the Empress Dowager.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.410
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.600
Calm yourself for now.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.670
Your command

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.720
has only been temporarily removed.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.150
Once the situation stabilizes,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.610
it will be restored to you.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.000
What troubles me is not

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.600
the loss of command
over the Imperial Guards,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.930
but the reason behind this sudden change!

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.660
Could it be that...

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.910
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager has lost

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.840
control over His Majesty?

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.440
Insolent!

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.510
How dare you speak

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.510
such treasonous words to me!

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.390
This subject has gravely offended you.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.840
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.720
At this point, I just want to know

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.600
what exactly happened in the palace.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.120
His Majesty went to see Feng Suige,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.870
and upon his return,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.080
stripped me of my command.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.670
Isn't that because

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.670
you and your father failed in your duty?

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.790
Feng Suige is still alive,

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.790
and I have yet to hold you to account.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.360
For now, I won't pursue this matter.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.420
The top priority is

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.840
to wait for your father

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.510
to secure control of the Feng Battalion.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.630
You must kill Feng Suige
as soon as possible.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.690
As for His Majesty,

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.550
I will handle him myself.

[Noble Virtue and Lofty Spirit]

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.980
Feng Suige,

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.130
show yourself!

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:29.840
Father?

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.390
Father!

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.900
Father, wake up...

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.910
Wake up, Father!

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.440
Father!

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.000
Father!

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.290
I was wrong.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.380
It was all my fault.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.100
If only I had listened to you back then

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.000
and been content as a spoiled noble,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.800
this would never have happened.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.680
I just wanted

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.550
to change our family's fate.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.079
I never thought it would cost your life,

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.079
Father...

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.790
I was wrong.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.960
I've failed you as a son!

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.569
When you tried to kill me before...

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.310
it was just like this.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.150
Feng Suige!

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.830
If you have a grievance,
take it out on me!

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.440
Why couldn't you

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.370
spare my father?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.030
Did you ever think about

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.470
sparing my father?

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.590
Back then, when you conspired with Jinxiu,

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.830
did you think about sparing

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.640
those innocent Susha soldiers?

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.200
When you personally

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.700
buried me in the ground,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.960
did you remember

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.610
we were once like brothers?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.440
I considered you

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.950
my best friend!

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.000
But from the moment
you conspired with Zhuang Shen,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
you knew

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.920
we'd become enemies.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:58.880
I never expected

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.720
that we would

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.610
come to this.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.900
When I watched you die,

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.640
I felt awful too.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.730
But now I regret it!

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.790
I regret not

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.590
making sure you were truly dead!

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.310
At this point,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.920
there's no need for empty words.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.440
Today,

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.170
I'll show no mercy.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.750
I'll rip you to shreds!

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.750
I'll kill you

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.960
to avenge my father!

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.030
This man has been

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.680
my best friend since childhood.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.340
He's a rare and honored guest.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.650
Make sure he's well taken care of.

do it!

Kill him!

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.170
I still can't believe

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.910
that my son

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.750
is actually

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.350
a villain who kills innocent people.

Only you are the most important
to the Murong family.

nothing is more important than you.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.370
Murong Zhong and his son are dead.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.920
The Murong family

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.350
will be erased from Susha.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.240
What did you say?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.290
That's impossible!

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.830
Even if the Murong family were to fall,

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.690
it couldn't happen this quickly!

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.970
Chengyang,

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.240
do you know...

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.500
without Murong Zhong and his son,

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.680
you and I

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.400
are no match

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.440
for Feng Suige?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.790
Mother,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.070
I know the truth now.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.270
What truth?

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.280
The truth about Father's death.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.820
Chengyang,

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.840
what are you talking about?

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.770
Tell Motherâ€”

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.070
who

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.480
has been filling your head with nonsense?

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.660
Is it Feng Suige?

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920
He's lying to you.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.440
He's trying to sow discord between us!

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.160
Mother!

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.800
When Murong Zhong died,

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.960
he'd already told my brother everything.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.580
Feng Suige is lying!

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.970
How can you believe him?

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.230
Whatever you heard,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.550
I didn't do it.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.890
None of this has anything to do with me!

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.800
It wasn't me.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:50.860
Chengyang,

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.160
listen to me.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.030
Are you still my son or not?

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.920
If you still acknowledge me
as your mother,

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.210
you must believe me!

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.000
I've always been your son.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.030
In my heart,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.210
no one is more important than you.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.070
That's why I can't watch you

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.480
continue down this wrong path.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.540
I've told youâ€”

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.860
I didn't do it!

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.680
I didn't kill your father!

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.590
Mother!

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.440
The truth will come out eventually.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.320
It can't be hidden anymore.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.310
No.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.480
I cannot lose.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.480
I've fought so hard to get to
where I am today.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.680
I cannot lose!

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.220
Aren't Murong Zhong and his son dead?

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.830
Right.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.770
They're dead.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.330
All the secrets

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.160
should be buried with them.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.010
Chengyang.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.030
Help me announce to the world

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.360
that all of this was done

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.280
by Murong Zhong and his son.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.170
It can't be hidden anymore.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.170
Chengyang,

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.920
everything I've done

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.030
was for you.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.080
Mother...

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.970
You're saying that again.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.550
You've always been

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.070
driven by your own obsession:

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.750
your son must be emperor.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.590
Whether your son

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.850
was me or someone else,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.850
you would have done the same thing.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.260
Don't use me as an excuse anymore.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.680
How could you say

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.030
such unfilial things to me?

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.900
Why have you come here to hurt me?

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.540
No matter what you've done wrong,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.610
I will atone for it on your behalf.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.830
What are you going to do?

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.030
I'm going to return the throne

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:32.890
to my brother.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.550
He'll rule Susha.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.310
Only then

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.500
can Father rest in peace.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.920
Mother,

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.640
please don't worry.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.100
I'll always stay with you.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.640
We'll go together

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.970
to guard Father's mausoleum.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.640
No!

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.830
I won't!

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.920
Never!

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.750
My mind is made up.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.800
Chengyang...

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.400
Chengyang!

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.750
Chengyang, you can't do this to me.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.440
Chengyang!

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.350
Chengyang!

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.720
Chengyang!

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.830
Chengyang,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.140
you can't do this to me...

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.550
You can't do this to your mother,

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.510
Chengyang!

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.680
Chengyang!

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.610
Your Highness,

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.680
we're all ready.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.550
We're just waiting for Your Highness
to give the command,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.880
and we'll follow you to the death

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.590
to reclaim your throne!

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.720
The throne rightfully belongs to you!

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.480
You have all followed me for many years

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.010
and are like brothers to me.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.680
You all know what kind of man

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.360
I, Feng Suige, am.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.210
I don't care about the throne.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.240
What I care about

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.000
is fighting alongside you

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.400
to protect our homeland.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.640
So, please stop trying

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.270
to persuade me to take the throne.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.920
Susha's peace was hard-won.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.270
There must be no more chaos.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.270
Otherwise, it's always the common people
who suffer.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.210
Today,

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.180
I'll depart for Jinxiu

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.560
to bring back my sister.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.030
While I'm gone,

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.910
I hope all of you

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.680
will protect Susha for me.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.480
-We will definitely guard our homeland
-We will definitely guard our homeland

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.880
-until Your Highness returns!
-until Your Highness returns!

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.480
All right.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.310
You may leave now.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.340
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:37.830
Yun Qing,

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.500
Lu Ke and Yun Fang

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.160
will accompany me to Jinxiu.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.350
I'm counting on you to manage things here.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.880
Besides,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.960
there's another important task

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.270
I need to entrust to you.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.270
Help me investigate

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.310
the truth behind the raid
on the Storm Alliance back then.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.790
Yes.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.030
I suspect it was most likely

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.650
Zhuang Shen who did it.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.610
But we don't have evidence yet.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.160
If he really did it,

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.960
someone in the Zhuang family
must know about it.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.270
Among those exiled from the Zhuang family,

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.870
someone must know the truth.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.310
Start there

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.590
to find a breakthrough.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.540
Then dig deeper

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.700
until you uncover the truth.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.430
Understood.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.480
You can count on me, Your Highness.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.970
On your journey to Jinxiu,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.000
be sure to stay safe.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.000
Don't worry.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:16.630
Oh, right.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:17.550
[Ning Fei]

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:18.110
Rush

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.140
this letter to Ning Fei

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.010
at Zhengnian Villa.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.700
[Ning Fei]

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.110
Yes.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.240
What right do you have to keep me here?

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.030
My brother is still alive.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.430
Of course, I need to return to Susha
to find him!

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.390
Just think about

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.030
all the things you've done for Xia Jingshi

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.550
that angered your brother.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.150
You think he wants to see you?

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.850
Get out of my way!

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.250
Feng Xiyang!

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.720
Remember this:

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.400
you're mine now!

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.120
Whether you stay or go...

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.350
depends entirely on my mood.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.960
Are you alright?

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:56.890
Someone, come!

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.070
Xiyang?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.460
Xiyang!

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.030
Why would she suddenly faint like that?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.550
Her Highness is pregnant.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.350
Your Majesty,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.750
Princess Xiyang is with child.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.570
What did you say?

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.920
She's definitely pregnant.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.550
If you dare make a wrong diagnosis,

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:25.680
I'll have your head.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.310
I wouldn't dare give a false diagnosis.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.350
Her Highness is indeed pregnant.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.880
Get out.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.720
Yes.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.740
All of you, out.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.900
You're pregnant.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.030
Whose child is it?

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.310
You and Xia Jingshi

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.330
were married

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.780
but never consummated the marriage.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.720
If this child isn't mine,

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.980
then whose could it be?

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.300
That's wonderful.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.840
Feng Xiyang,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.090
I'll marry you.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.710
I'll make you my Empress!

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.900
I, Feng Xiyang, would sooner die

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.160
than become your Empress!

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.860
Your Highness, you've returned.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.700
You must be hungry.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.830
Shall I have the meal brought in?

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.030
Your Highness, you've had

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.680
little appetite these past few days.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.000
I've had hawthorn and apricot soup

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.060
prepared for you.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.440
It's sweet and sour

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.500
and should stimulate your appetite.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.690
What are you talking about?

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.580
Your Highness,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.210

are you all right?

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.030
This maid will go see

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.350
if lunch is ready.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:35.840
This subject

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.550
pays respects to Your Majesty.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.010
Speak plainly. What is it?

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.120
Your Majesty,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.850
an urgent message from Sushaâ€”

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.960
Feng Suige is already

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.560
on his way to Shengjing City.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.520
What is he coming for?

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.469
Your Majesty,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.750
the message only says

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.300
Feng Suige wishes to
meet with Your Majesty.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.570
He's coming to take Feng Xiyang back.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.550
I won't see him.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.070
Find some excuse to turn him away.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.280
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.630
Wait.

The news of Feng Suige coming to Shengjing

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.670

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.000
reach Princess Xiyang.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.030
If you leak a word of this,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.500
I'll not spare you.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.440
Yes.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.360

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.020

[Princess Xiyang is secretly pregnant
with the Emperor's child.]

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.890

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.330

Your Highness?

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.210
She's pregnant with Xia Jingyan's child.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.000
You mean Princess Xiyang?

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.360
If she had listened to me back then

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.040
and returned to Susha,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.110
none of this

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.310
would have happened.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.760
It's too late now.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.280
She brought this upon herself.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.370
She has only herself to blame.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.550
At midnight on Xia Jingyan's birthday,

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.800
he'll go to the ancestral home

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.150
to pay respects to the ancestors.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.880
He usually

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.610
arrives there a day in advance.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.320
And this time, he'll certainly
bring Feng Xiyang

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.150
with him.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.220
At that time,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.360

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.490

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.630
Xia Jingyan and Feng Xiyang...

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.150
must both die.

[Shengjing City, Jinxiu Kingdom]

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.480
You're quite familiar with this place.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.940
Have you been here before?

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.880
I came here once

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.150
when I had business outside the border.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.370
After all these years,

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.700
it hasn't changed much.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.660
I didn't expect it to be so lively.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.920
Because the day after tomorrow

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.650
is Jinxiu's Qianqiu Festivalâ€”

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:01.440
that is, Emperor

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.840
Xia Jingyan's birthday.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.880
According to Jinxiu customs,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.550
the Qianqiu Festival lasts three days.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.220
At midnight on his birthday, the Emperor

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.280
visits his ancestral home
to honor his ancestors.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.240
Later that day,

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.590
he parades through the streets
to celebrate with the people.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.520
On the third day,

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:15.400
he meets

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.320
the nobles and officials

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.520

with Xia Jingyan is scheduled.

Understood.

Let's go there first to settle in.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.750

I knew you were still alive.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.030
No need for formalities.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.590
Get up.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.810
His name is Yu Qi.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.110
He's a secret agent
from my Feng Battalion,

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.070
operating undercover in Jinxiu

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.070
under my orders to collect intelligence.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.200
We've come this time

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.650
to bring my sister back.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.850
How is she doing?

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:13.760
According to news from the palace,

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.440
Princess Xiyang

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.230
has divorced the Prince of Zhennan,
Xia Jingshi.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.280
It was Princess Xiyang

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.840
who repudiated Xia Jingshi.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.440
What?

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.630
How is that possible?

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.840
Princess Xiyang has always been devoted

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.700
to Xia Jingshi.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880
How could she repudiate him?

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.940
I looked into it too

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:25.960
but couldn't find out

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.710
the reason.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.020
There are rumors

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.010
that this matter is related to
Emperor Xia Jingyan.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.070
Your Highness,

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.150
I went to the Ministry of Rites and asked.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.070
Those fools said

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.550
the meeting time hasn't been arranged yet.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.110
They said

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.070
we have to wait until
after the Qianqiu Festival.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:37.870
I've told them

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.280
to inform us here at once

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.010
if there are any developments.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:42.440
They're clearly

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.770
just stalling for time.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.150
Xiyang might already be in trouble.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.440
Stay calm for now.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.480
On our way here,

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.510
I already told you about this.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.840
This time,

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.550
bringing Princess Xiyang back to Susha

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.360
won't be easy.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.710
I know better than anyone how deeply

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.360
Xiyang's feelings run for Xia Jingshi.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.070
How could she possibly repudiate him?

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.280
Besides, everyone knows

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.440
the Emperor of Jinxiu, Xia Jingyan,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.640
is not a man of virtue.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.360
If he's involved in this,

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.890
then I'm even more worried.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.030
Why is he preventing me
from seeing Xiyang?

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.250
Perhaps

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.970
he wants to use your sister

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:13.310

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:15.080
or for some other reason.

our urgent priority is

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.710
to find out

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.400
about Xiyang's situation in the palace.

Her name is Peiniang.

She was once a palace attendant
in the Jinxiu Imperial Palace

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.000
and served there for over 20 years.
