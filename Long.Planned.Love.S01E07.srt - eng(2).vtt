00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.020
(Half a month later, meeting between the parents
of Zhou Yufeng and Jiang Yawei)

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.790
Let me say something you don't like.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.640
Even if you called off
the engagement with Jian Cheng,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.260
you still shouldn't be with Jiang Yawei.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.560
If you really like her,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.430
just keep her as a mistress.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.120
Mom,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.760
Yawei is actually great.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.870
She's been putting up with a lot.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.590
Putting up with it?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.070
She and us

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
are from completely different worlds.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.150
Some circles

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.480
won't accept her
just because she endures.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.400
Just now,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.510
look at her humble attitude.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.350
I felt embarrassed for you.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.150
I wasn't embarrassed.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.920
You weren't?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.840
Then why are you sitting here alone?

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.760
If you ask me,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.070
this Jiang Yawei

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.710
isn't even as good as Jian Cheng.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.310
Best not bring her out so often.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.430
She makes you look bad.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.680
I feel embarrassed for Jiang Yawei.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.280
Look at her mother-in-law's attitude.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.980
Her life won't be easy
in the Zhou Family.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.480
There's really boring.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.760
Right now,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.590
I'm eager to see Jian Cheng
regain her memory.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.590
Me too.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.950
Days with Jian Cheng around
are way more interesting.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.960
Congrats,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.030
Jiang Yawei.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.120
You're lucky.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.360
You met the unyielding Cheng.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.310
That's true.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.120
Every time she stands her ground,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.200
Zhou Yufeng

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.120
takes another step away from her.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.630
Now you've got what you wanted.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.360
Welcome

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.080
to your own personal hell.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.630
(Ye Qi, third sister-in-law of the Zhou Family)
(What a petty way to act!)

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.140
(Guan Qingrou, Zhou Lu's mother)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.360
(Why isn't my uncle here yet?)

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.480
(Could he be deliberately
keeping us waiting?)

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.080
Everyone's here.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.360
Long time no see, everyone.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.190
Do you miss me?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.560
Congrats, nephew.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.740
What did you just call me?

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.030
Nephew?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.240
Yeah.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.800
I'm married now.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.960
No need to keep pretending.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.800
Keep some dignity for yourself.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.710
Just go.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.960
Nephew, how many times have I told you?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.150
In my heart,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.360
there's only your uncle.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
As for the past,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.800
no matter how you talk it up,
I won't believe a word.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.470
And now,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.750
I'm your aunt.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.430
I've got a marriage certificate
with your uncle.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.250
What marriage certificate?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.910
What marriage certificate?

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.360
Why could he get married
with you?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.870
(Jian Cheng is having another episode.)

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.750
See?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.440
(Jian Cheng)
Isn't this me and your uncle?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.760
(Marriage Certificate)
Aren't those our names?

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.980
Got a good look, nephew?

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.800
Got a clear look,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.280
you guys?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.590
Give me it.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.720
Let me see.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.590
It's gotta be fake.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.160
What if you tear it up?

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.360
I won't tear it.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.460
Let me check if it's a fake.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.230
Ignorant of the law?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.360
Making a fake one is illegal.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.200
Don't you know?

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.280
Give it to me.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.200
Give it to me.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.000
Just try touching her again.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.790
Are you OK?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.040
Honey, what took you so long?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.680
Zhou Lu is waiting for you downstairs.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.910
You go down first.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.640
Yeah.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.960
Uncle,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.780
her marriage certificate is fake,
isn't it?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.550
How could you possibly marry her?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.050
We've already registered the marriage.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.760
So,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.510
in exchange for your life-saving favor,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.430
you demand my uncle to marry you.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.080
Yeah.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.840
You're perfectly sane.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.680
Just to avoid embarrassment today?

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.030
Yeah.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.400
Well,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.510
given our relationship,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.750
why didn't you tell me this earlier?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.400
You don't trust me?

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.030
That's not it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Not at all.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.600
I'm afraid you might get too excited
and spill it.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.400
Alright then.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.150
Uncle,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.240
when she snaps out of it,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.870
and finds out I'm already married

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.600
and she's married to you,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.870
what if she loses it even more?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.240
I'll make her fall for me before that.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.000
So even if she wakes up,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.160
she won't pester you anymore.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.630
Everyone's happy.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.150
What do you think?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.000
In my opinion,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.320
actually,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.630
Tingyan marrying Jian Cheng
is the best choice.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.680
Jian Cheng is honestly a wonderful girl.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.840
Qingrou,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.120
I've never heard you speak
so sweetly before.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.630
But right now,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.870
you're pretty good at it.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.120
Guess we're just not high enough.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.750
I'm marrying Jian Cheng.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.800
Anyone still confused?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.000
- But...
- I'm marrying Jian Cheng.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.310
Who dares to object?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.590
Tingyan,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.200
(Zhou Guoqing, Mr. Zhou)
come with me.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.800
Tingyan,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.160
this isn't like you.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.070
If you really don't want to marry her,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.240
whether it's problems from Jian Cheng

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.310
or Qianyi,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.800
you've got other ways to handle it.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.800
You don't have to drag yourself
into this.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.560
I'm not getting any younger.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.310
It's time to get married.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.400
But didn't you say

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.780
you'd never marry in this lifetime?

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.150
Tingyan,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.000
while no one outside knows,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.160
you quietly

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.340
get the divorce certificates.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.560
Let's pretend nothing happened today.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.640
As for Jian Cheng,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.190
I'll inform her parents

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.270
to take her home

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.680
and send her abroad.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.750
I'll cover the expenses.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.560
Just as long as she's gone...

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.400
What?

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.790
Are you worried I'll embarrass you?

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.750
You weren't worried back then.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.370
What should I be afraid of?

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.870
So,

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.480
you married Jian Cheng

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.800
just to spite me?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.520
Spite you?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.990
You're thinking too much.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.870
I married Jian Cheng

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.510
simply because I wanted to.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.590
It has nothing to do with you.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.630
You dare to marry my uncle.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.440
You've got some guts.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.250
I should call you Bold Jian from now on.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.790
You've already seen
how fierce Second Aunt can be.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.390
You also know
what the Zhou Family is like.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.440
Then there's Third Aunt,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.840
Fourth Aunt,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.160
and other aunts.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.440
None of them are easy to deal with.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.550
If it's not easy,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.320
then we'll fall out completely.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.390
I'm not backing down.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.750
I remember

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.790
you once told me

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.550
that Ye Qi always picked on your mom.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.550
If you don't speak,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.450
it means she's still giving her
a hard time.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.550
I just realized

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.790
their clothing styles look so alike.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.200
Well, I have to say,

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.080
you two even have similar taste.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.920
(Got something to do)

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.510
The things you like

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.080
are practically the same.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.750
Ye Qi,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.390
you're hitting menopause, huh?

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.790
What menopause?

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.150
Didn't you say

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.030
that you just saw Yawei

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.080
wearing the same style of clothes
as mine?

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.670
Well, she arrived this noon,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.080
and you've been chatting with her.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.840
How could you not know
what she was wearing?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.790
Listen to me.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.080
That's what menopause is like.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.670
Your memory starts to slip.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.260
Your temper gets quick to flare.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.840
Even your skin loses firmness.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.910
You two just talked for so long.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.790
Yet you instantly forgot what she wore.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.320
You really have a terrible memory.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.790
I didn't mean it like that.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.870
Ye Qi,

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.440
do you even know you're in menopause?

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.200
If you're not sure,

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.720
better go to the hospital.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.550
Earlier diagnosis means
earlier treatment.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.320
That's not what I mean.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.320
I just blurted it out.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.200
Maybe I didn't explain myself well.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.150
I mean,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.080
I simply didn't notice it earlier

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.510
and I just happened to notice it.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.440
Cheng,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.790
don't get hung up
on just a couple of words.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.200
You really didn't make yourself clear.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.960
You said

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.080
that Yawei and I

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.510
share the same taste

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.320
and we like the same things.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.840
Are you really talking
about our preferences,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.680
or

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.150
what you really meant was

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.270
I like Yufeng?

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.720
Yufeng?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.440
I never mentioned Yufeng.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.440
Don't get me wrong.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.030
Why bring up Yufeng suddenly?

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.600
Cheng,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.630
you're Tingyan's wife now.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.390
As for you and Yufeng,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.600
don't bring it up...

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.200
Ye Qi, look, you forgot again.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.200
I hit my head before.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.840
I don't remember things from before.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.910
How could I keep thinking
about the past?

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.790
Ye Qi, this is just menopause.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.670
Your memory's getting worse.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.280
Alright, enough.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.560
Jian Cheng,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.200
tone it down a bit.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.300
Ye Qi

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.840
is older than you.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.440
If she blames you,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.080
you have to listen.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.790
Is she older than me?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.160
I'm bad at math. Let me check.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.600
I'm

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.910
24 this year.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.390
She's

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.510
48 this year.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.890
I wouldn't have noticed
if you didn't say.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.160
Ye Qi,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.790
you're 24 years older than me.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.320
Listen to me.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.960
Women usually enter menopause

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.150
between the ages of 45 and 55.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.550
That's risky for you.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.080
Thanks for your concern, Cheng.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.270
If I get the chance,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.970
I'll definitely go to the hospital.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.670
You really should go.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.390
Honey.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.800
Let's head home.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.870
OK.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.390
It hurts.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.200
You have no idea how impressive
I was just now.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.230
Don't wear shoes

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.380
you're not used to next time.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.040
No way.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.510
Tang said

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.550
Mrs. Zhou needs to stay elegant.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.590
But I just want to see you run free
like a wild horse,

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.550
breaking all the rules.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200
Zhou Tingyan,

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.870
give me a hug.
