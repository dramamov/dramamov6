Sorry. The person you're calling

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.510
is busy making money.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.640
You troublemaker.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.920
Where've you been these days?

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.770
You missed my calls.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.290
Just get to the point.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.600
You registered your marriage
with Zhou Tingyan.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.330
Yeah.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.230
From

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.790
we've been betting up to now,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.040
it's been half a month.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.280
Which means

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.060
when you made that bet with me,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.680
you were confident about winning over him.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.120
You knew you'd win.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.950
That's why you set up that whole bet

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.790
to trap me.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.680
All just so,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.710
you could snatch that 9% stake.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.870
Bingo.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.640
Congrats, you got it right.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.950
You sly little thing.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.040
Back then,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.400
you even put Changhuai Road
on the table.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.070
You knew I couldn't resist it.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.800
Why didn't you go for more?

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.960
You're bold enough.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.430
Why not think about

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.590
matching your brother's level directly?

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.240
I didn't believe
you'd win over Zhou Tingyan.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.120
Maybe,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.310
my gambling itch kicked in

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.750
and I promised to bet.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.590
Because I know you so well.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.310
I had to use my biggest bet,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.630
but only 1% higher than Jian Wenqian's.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.400
That way you'd think

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.710
I was doing it just to spite her.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.240
So you'd take my bet.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.960
So Jian,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.120
you can't blame me for this.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.000
Because you were thinking

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.310
if you won,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.910
Changhuai Road would be yours.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
And if I won,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.520
Zhou Tingyan would be your son‑in‑law.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.840
Either way, you couldn't lose.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.080
Deep down, you felt

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.030
a man like Zhou Tingyan

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.400
would never marry a loser like me.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.190
How did you manage to win over him?

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.030
I heard you pressured him

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.910
because he owed you his life.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.360
Mm-hm.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.350
Yeah.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.560
I told him straight up.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.910
If he didn't marry me,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.800
I'd jump off Qianyi Group's rooftop.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.520
So Jian,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.190
we've got an agreement here.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.280
You'd better get those papers done fast

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.640
and call me over to sign.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.080
If you try to back out,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.310
I'll hold a banner
outside Changsheng Group,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.080
saying you don't keep your word.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.150
You rebellious girl.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.030
Cheng,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.470
as for you now,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.800
you've already married Zhou Tingyan.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.080
When will you bring him home for dinner?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.680
Why didn't you ask me,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.540
why I got the marriage license ages ago

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.740
but only made it public now?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.470
You got the point.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.960
Why?

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.240
Zhou Tingyan wanted to keep it quiet.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.710
He didn't want it public.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.280
Why wouldn't he want to make it public?

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.360
Obviously, he thinks

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.150
marrying me is embarrassing.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.910
Now he gets annoyed just seeing me.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.080
No, that's not right.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.190
I heard that day at their home,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.950
he kept shielding you.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.120
That was in public.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.040
He had to play the loving husband role.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.430
In private, when it's just us.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.720
He completely ignores me.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.880
What about you?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.190
Can you… help me out here?

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.510
Maybe drop by Master Zhou's place
a few times.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.310
Are you seriously joking right now?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.630
You think I can see him whenever I want?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.120
So, Jian,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.510
if you're asking me for help,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.830
I'm afraid I can't do much.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.040
Maybe when I can make

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.920
Zhou Tingyan truly fall for me

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.920
and have real influence with him,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.960
I can help you.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.120
Alright, enough said, Jian.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.040
I need to build something
with Zhou Tingyan.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.600
Or you'll lose both shares and daughter.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.440
Okay?

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.390
(Aunt Guan)
Sorry, the person you're calling...

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.680
And now who is this?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.040
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.360
Send one even if it's not.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.200
Thanks.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.480
Sorry.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.360
Aunt Guan.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.920
Cheng, can you come
to the Ancestral House?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.950
Lu and Yufeng got into a fight.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.430
Master Zhou is furious with Lu.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.830
I really don't know what to do.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.040
Stay calm.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.880
I'm on my way.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.190
Aunt Fang.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.070
Where's Zhou Tingyan?

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.470
He woke up an hour ago.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.190
Had breakfast and went to the office.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.800
He said you should sleep more.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.120
He'll come back for lunch.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.560
Tell him I'm going to the Ancestral House.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.720
We won't have lunch together.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.520
Alright.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.200
Sir, Mrs. Zhou is already up.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.120
She didn't have time for breakfast.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.000
She went to the Ancestral House

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.360
and won't join you for lunch.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.720
You're driving me crazy.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.640
Dad, stop hitting him.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.070
Please let Lu off.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.510
I'm begging you.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.510
Qingrou, Lu messed up.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.070
He deserves the punishment.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.630
Besides,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.000
he broke

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.920
Dad's favorite vase.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.000
Do you admit it?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.320
No.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.370
Still talking back, huh?

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.350
Hey.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360
Everyone's here.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.950
Zhou Lu,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.320
have you committed some crime?

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.560
Why have you beaten up like this?

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.980
What happened to your neck?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.320
I'm just as miserable as you.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.000
Lately, there's been a misfortune.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.310
When we have free time,

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.630
I'll take you along

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.480
to the temple to get a safety amulet.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.510
That way, we won't

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.600
keep getting set up by petty people.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.400
Dad,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.720
why did you hit Zhou Lu?

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.190
He did something wrong.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.560
Dad,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.920
I have a way to prove

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.430
that Zhou Lu didn't break that vase.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.910
How?

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.270
You.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.920
You said you saw Zhou Lu smash the vase.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.120
Words alone mean nothing.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.150
Bring evidence.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.430
We all saw it happen.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.680
Isn't that enough?

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.510
Now I finally see the truth.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.190
And right now,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.620
it's Jiang Yawei,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.130
my eldest nephew,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.430
and my sister-in-law.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.040
These three

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.040
all claim they saw
Zhou Lu break the vase.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.410
But there's no proof at all.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.710
You can't convict on just words.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.720
That's ridiculous.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.600
So I could randomly accuse someone too?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.320
You, Jiang Yawei.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.000
I suspect you broke that vase

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.390
and then framed Zhou Lu on purpose.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.680
Zhou Lu, what are you doing?

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.950
(How does she know?)

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.600
You have a strong motive.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.190
Because usually,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.310
Zhou Lu doesn't like you.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.000
So you took the chance to get back at him.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.510
My nephew, you...

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.080
You're an accomplice.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.480
Because she's your wife.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480
You're covering for her.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.960
My sister-in-law's in menopause.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.840
Her words don't count.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.680
You again?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.360
Dad, none of those three can be trusted.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.600
They don't have any proof.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.390
It's possible they falsely accused Zhou Lu.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.120
Unless you make them show real evidence.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.870
Jian Cheng.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.480
You keep asking us for proof.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.620
But Zhou Lu can't produce proof

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.080
to clear his own name either.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.960
If he had proof,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.240
he wouldn't have been beaten so badly.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.960
They're the ones who accused him first.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.080
So they should bring evidence first.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.080
With logic like yours,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.250
how do you run the household?

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.630
You...

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.210
If you think it's unfair,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.480
why not just call the police?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.320
It's the fairest way.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.750
He got beaten like this
and still kept quiet.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.390
It means he's innocent.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.300
- Jian Cheng.
- I'm Mrs. Zhou.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.630
This is a private matter of my family.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.340
If the police get involved,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.000
people will laugh at us.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.230
Exactly.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.200
The family's reputation comes first.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.720
Let's not blow this up.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.630
Lu's already been beaten.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.870
So I think,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.030
we should just drop it here.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.240
Zhou Lu's been hurt this badly.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.450
- How can we...
- Jian Cheng.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840
What are you doing here?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960
Such a thing happened.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.080
Why didn't you call me?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.070
Tingyan.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.750
The two-tone vase your mom left behind.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.970
Lu broke it.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.250
It wasn't Zhou Lu.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.200
They said they saw it happen.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.550
But none of them has proof.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.040
I know.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.870
Don't worry.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.020
When someone is alive,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.150
you never value them.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.000
Once they're gone, don't fake affection.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.320
Tingyan.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.270
Can a vase ever be worth a life?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.800
And besides,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.360
my mom didn't even like that vase.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.030
It's just you thinking she did.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.180
You forced all your ideas onto her.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.030
She's gone,
and you still won't let her be.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.870
Glad it's broken.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.390
That's great.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.390
Doesn't matter if it was you.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.710
You still got hurt.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.240
I'll give you credit.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.720
Just keep the bar as a side gig.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.750
Once you're healed, come find me.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.910
Manager of Investment Department Ⅱ.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.750
The post is yours.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.130
Uncle Zhou.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.150
You must be joking.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.320
Investment Department Ⅱ.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.000
When have I ever joked with you?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
The capital market
isn't about seniority.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.910
If I say he's capable,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.160
then he is.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.270
Zhou Lu isn't qualified, right?

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.630
Qualified or not,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.470
I decide.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.920
Here's the thing.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.200
Why are you involved in

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.240
all the mess lately?

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.240
I've been in a bad mood lately.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.200
Please give me some space.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.480
Or do you think your husband is too free?

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.600
I could give him more work if you want.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.600
Why did you bring Zhou Lu
into the business?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.340
Don't underestimate him.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.030
Such a thing happened.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.600
Why didn't you call me?

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.320
I…

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.390
Yesterday it was Meng Tang.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.510
Today it's Zhou Lu.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.910
Meng Tang's your friend, I get that.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.030
But Zhou Lu is your childhood pal

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.550
and also my nephew.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.320
Something happened.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.870
Why didn't you tell me?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.960
Well…

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.600
I honestly didn't know

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.240
whether this vase is important to you.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.870
If you'd seen it break and gotten furious,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.790
he would've been in trouble.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.460
Besides,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.100
I never planned on hiding it from you.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.870
I was meant to

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.960
clear Zhou Lu's name first,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.240
then come talk to you.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.910
Are Meng Tang and Zhou Lu

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.720
really that important to you?

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.550
Mm-hm.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.600
Very important.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.320
Who else matters to you,

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.600
apart from them?

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.630
Anyone still alive?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.470
Yeah.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.440
Tang.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.680
Zhou Lu.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.800
My aunt.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.840
Uh-huh.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.110
Mm-hm.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.230
That's all?

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.960
Yeah, that's it.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.290
Do you think I'm gone for good?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.390
No, you're still alive.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.470
Well, Jian Cheng,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.000
I didn't make to the top 3.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.720
At least put me last on it.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.360
So what were you doing this morning?

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.270
To the hospital this morning.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.670
Qin Zhuo got beaten into

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.630
the hospital by Tang.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.360
Is Tang okay?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.040
Meng Tang's fine.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.390
It's Qin Zhuo who's hurt.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.750
That's a relief.
