00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:05.410
still trust and follow
the Senior Guardian General.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.954
Don't you think
that's actually better for us?

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:12.792
The commoners trust and follow him
as if he were king.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.253
If that's not a traitor, then what is?

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.674
The Senior Guardian General
was an outstanding government official

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:20.967
and officer,

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.971
yet I never respected the General
at any point along his career.

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:28.850
Ultimately, human nature
is like a starving demon.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:33.229
It's all disgusting and rotten.
It's total hypocrisy.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:35.315
And do not forget.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:39.861
His death is the only way
for you to survive.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:46.034
By working tirelessly,
I'll bring to you evidence you require

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.910
to prove he's guilty of treason.

[Jung Chun sighs]

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.830
It's late out. Why are you here?

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:35.666
I came all this way...

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:40.004
because I need to ask you
to do me a favor.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.631
What kind of favor?

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.350

How did you get your hands on this?

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:14.122
Siyul was never able to leave Mapo,
you see... [inhales]

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.667
all because of that letter.

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:20.461
Just tell me what's happening.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:25.591
I am worried that right now,

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.469
Siyul is heading
straight into the belly of the beast.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.142
Only you can put a stop to him, My Lord.

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:38.521
Siyul needs to leave Mapo
for his own good.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.358
So convince him to go.

Siyul, why didn't you tell me?

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.284
I had never expected that
my letter would put you in this situation.

I think you'd better go.

I don't wish to talk to anyone right now.

You can hold it against me if you want.

But I don't want you to get hurt.

You needn't worry.

How could I fault you for that?

You do what you have to do.

And I'll do what I have to.

Thank you.

You treat bandits as if we're snakes.

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:44.392
These days, I've been getting
really sick of seeing you.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.186
If you want me to leave, I will.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.397
But first...

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.943
I will give back
what I owe you before I do.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.655
How thick in the head
could you possibly be, kid?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.825
Pursuing revenge is a bad idea.

Wang Hae's not someone
you should mess with.

Whatever you say,
it won't make a difference to me.

And then what?

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:21.804
Have you considered
the consequences at all?

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:24.849
After you cause a scene
and leave us all here?

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.976
Do you think we can survive on our own?

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:30.646
I'm beggin' you not to do anything
for our sakes and just go!

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:32.523
Sorry, but I can't.

You idiot!

So we'll be stuck

and it'll all be thanks to you?

Do you think I can't just kill you myself?

If I take this letter over
to the Police Bureau,

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:47.455

to slice your tongue off with an axe!

Until I know that
the fruit has been ripened.

00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:25.594
Absolutely.

00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:30.850
If you pick the fruit when it's not ripe,
you cannot enjoy the sweet flavor.

The time is upon us.

00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:36.981
