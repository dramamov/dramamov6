Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.040
I thought you were gonna be late.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880
What about Fon?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.640
She's coming, Wanmai.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.880
The girls are ready.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.240
Alrighty.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.880
Here,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.640
take this.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.760
Okay.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.400
Ready?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.800
Okay, let's go.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840
Move a little closer.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.040
The chemistry's insane, don't you think?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.280
Yep,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.400
I'm starting to think
this is a pre-wedding shoot.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.960
A little closer, please.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.800
You're late, as always.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.000
And pretty, as always.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.120
Hm...

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.480
Maybe prettier than usual?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.920
Try saying I'm not pretty

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.680
if you wanna be dead.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.360
What are you doing?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.000
Thank you for today, everyone.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.240
Alright, this is gonna be
your last work for the year.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.600
Get a good rest after this,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.080
and let's do it again next year.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.640
Rest up during this three-day holiday.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.000
I even turned down
the New Year's countdown event,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.400
so you two can have
some romantic time together.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560
So, where are you going
for the New Year's countdown?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.920
[Wednesday, December 31,
11:59 P.M.]

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.880
Rey, it's almost time!

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.880
Thank you, Rey,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.480
for making it through this year with me.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.640
You are the best thing
that has happened to me this year.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.400
So are you.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.920
What makes this a good year for me

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.120
is you, Print.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.480
[Thursday, January 1,
12:00 A.M.]

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.120
Happy New Year, Rey.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.800
Happy New Year, Print.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.840
Let's do a countdown together
every year from now on.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.160
Mm.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.720
Come on, let's get some more drinks.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.080
I'll get some for you.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.040
- Wait here.
- Okay.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.760
[Happy New Year]

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.720
[You passed the audition]

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.680
- Cheers!
- Yay!

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.960
Congratulations on your new company.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.720
I wish for your company
to slay, eat, and leave no crumbs.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.400
Most importantly,
if you ever find a new favorite girl,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.400
don't forget your original ones!

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.480
Who would ever forget you guys?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.760
Good.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.440
Then I'll join
your company as the first artist!

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.880
Mai,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.480
get the contract ready.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.040
Chop-chop!

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.920
- Isn't this too soon?
- Just get it done!

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.920
You're impatient, huh?

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.200
- Bring it on!
- Right now?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.480
- Right now!
- Just hang on.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.600
Have you heard back
from the Korean casting project?

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.200
Uh, Rey...

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.640
Why didn't you tell me you made the cut?

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.600
Wait, you knew?

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.000
Did you forget
I was the one submitting the video?

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.880
They asked for a secondary contact,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.800
so I put mine down.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.960
You're right...

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.800
Didn't we promise

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.160
not to keep secrets from each other?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.040
I wasn't planning
on keeping it a secret,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
but...

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.320
I've already decided
I'm not gonna take the offer.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.600
Why is that?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.400
The project
was recommended to you by Nicha,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.800
and I don't want a job
from your family's home-wrecker.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.880
But this is very important for you

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.280
to have another shot
at your acting career.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.040
Plus,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.000
who recommended this project
doesn't matter as much as

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.240
the fact that you earned it
with your skills, right?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040
Mm...

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.280
It's gonna be fine, Rey.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.400
I already turned it down.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.920
I'm sorry...

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.760
for not telling you
about my decision before this.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Hello?

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040
Print!

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.280
There's a project for you!

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.680
What project?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.120
A Korean agency

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.040
just contacted me!

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.680
Girl,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.960
I've already told you I didn't make it.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.040
No! Could you just listen?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.120
This one's another agency.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.320
They watched your audition video

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.040
and are really interested in you!

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200
For real?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.240
And it's another agency?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.720
Yeah.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.400
They said they wanted you
to sign a contract to work in Korea.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.080
But it's a three-year contract.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.400
Are you okay with that?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.640
What?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.040
Three years?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.880
That's a long time...

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.280
Whoa, guys...

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.480
you don't have
to make a big deal out of this!

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.600
- You're too extra...
- Hey, hey!

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.360
Frank,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.000
when are you gonna stop crying?

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.320
I'm going to Korea,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.520
not hell.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.880
But it's three years.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.000
It's gonna be so quiet around here.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.240
Who's even gonna nag at me now?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.400
Alright, don't be so blue, everyone.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.760
It's time for the presents!

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.000
Print, come open these up!

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
Three, two, one...

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240
Really?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.320
Who are these from?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.880
Those are from us.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.160
I'm just worried
you're gonna miss Mom's cooking.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.320
Kamsahamnida!

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.480
Next...

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.520
Wait, ginger tea?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.760
It's gonna be cold over there.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.120
This will prevent you from getting sick.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.240
Thank you,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.280
Mother.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.880
This one's definitely from Rey!

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320
Girl!

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.560
- Is it?
- Mm!

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.040
Here I go.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.160
Aw!

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.440
That's adorable!

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.600
No, don't.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.040
Wait, show me!

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080
Let me see!

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.520
Give it to me!

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.480
- Ooh, that's some lovey-dovey stuff!
- So smoochy!

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.080
Show them.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.120
It's cute.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.840
We can do that too, baby girl!

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.600
- Thanks, love.
- Can I see?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.120
I wanna see!

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.200
Hey, Patty!

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.800
This is not for children!

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.040
Why? You saw it!

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.040
I'm a grown adult.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.880
- I'm also grown.
- Just let her see it. Here.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.560
Where are you taking me, Print?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.720
You'll see.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.520
Is this...

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.600
- Uh...
- It's our home, Rey.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.640
It was gonna be for my family,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.840
but I'm just afraid
it's gonna turn into a haunted place

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.600
since no one would move in.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.120
While I'm away,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.400
would you take care of the house for me?

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.920
You can come here to relax

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.080
or lounge around occasionally.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.440
Wait for the day
I come live with you, please?

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.360
Are you actually tricking me
into being a maid?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.680
Nuh-uh, that's not it!

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.320
I...

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.680
wanted this house

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.720
to be our bridal house.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.240
How could it be?

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.360
Someone here's not even proposing.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.440
Uh...

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.720
Oh...

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.360
Just a sec.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.720
What do I use?

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.640
Then, I'm going
to give you a promise ring.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.200
Wait for me to come back, Rey.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.440
Mm.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.480
Then...

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.720
I'm saving you for myself, too.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.680
It's Valentine's Day,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.760
but Print is overseas,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.560
and Fon is busy with her schedule.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.280
I guess we're
the two loneliest people in the world.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.600
Flowers wither.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.080
I'm not really into this kind of stuff.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.560
It's whatever.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.040
Is it?

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.560
This is the first bouquet
I've ever arranged in my life.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.320
Is it really whatever?

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.880
Aww!

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.400
It's also the first bouquet
I've ever received.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.880
Yay!!

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.080
Aw...

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.600
Happy Valentine's Day.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.600
It reeks of love here.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640
Print,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.080
my project just got a green light.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.280
Book a flight back home
for my press conference.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.200
Mr. Kim said
your work over the past three years

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.920
has been more outstanding
than anyone else's in the agency.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.440
For this reason,
he wants to extend your contract

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.360
for another seven years.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.320
What do you think, Print?

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.360
[Print in talks to extend contract
seven more years with the same agency]

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.240
Congrats, Print,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.280
for the contract extension.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.560
Let's now talk about
the intense storyline of this series.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.200
I've heard it has something to do
with the entertainment industry,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.400
so can you please give us
a brief summary of the plot?

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.440
Right, it's about two famous stars

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.840
who have always been competitors,

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.440
until one day, when they switch bodies.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.560
Though they wholeheartedly
dislike each other,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.960
they become
more understanding of each other,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.560
so much so that
love blooms between them.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.760
Wow, what a fascinating storyline!

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.440
Could you tell us
where you draw the inspiration from?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.520
Actually, it's based on true events

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.240
and my first-hand experiences in life.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.000
Alright, let's now
discuss the leads of the series.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.360
Many people speculate
that one of the leads would portray you.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.520
If that's the case, who's the other lead

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.080
intended to portray?

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.080
The character is inspired by...

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.480
my biggest rival

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040
and closest friend,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.960
someone...

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.680
my heart belongs to.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.800
Oh!

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.520
And do you still meet this person?

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.840
What is your relationship now?

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.920
We don't meet often,

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.960
but despite that...

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.160
I'm still happy for their success

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.720
from afar.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440
I think

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.640
that's enough to be grateful for.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.040
I have a question!

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.280
Gosh!

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.360
- Isn't she supposed to be in Korea?
- Right?!

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.720
Whoa!

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.240
What if that person doesn't want you
to watch from afar anymore, Miss Rey?

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.960
What if they want to be
the one handing you the flowers?

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.000
What if they want to clean the house

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.040
and celebrate the countdown
with you every year from now on?

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.240
It would be lovely

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.920
to have you by my side, Print.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.080
Aw!

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.000
I decided not to extend the contract

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.680
since I feel like Thailand's industry
is a better fit for me.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.720
I didn't throw
that chance away, though.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.600
We agreed to keep
each other's contact info

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.040
in case they need me.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.640
If you didn't come back,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.880
some people would feel lonelier
than they already did.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.960
Who do you mean?

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.120
Are you one of them?

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.520
I mean your mom, Patty, and Frank.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240
What about you, though?

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.320
How much have I missed

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.200
after being gone for three years?

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.680
Fill me in!

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.880
I wanna know everything!

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.200
Hm...

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.400
Where do you wanna start?

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.080
How about we start with your mother?

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.080
I saw the news about her on TV.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.160
Mother made her comeback after 20 years.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.360
Everything went beautifully,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.920
and she's even more famous than me now.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.000
Cut!

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.880
- Alright, cut!
- Amazing work!

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.280
The workaholics like Mai and Fon

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.360
haven't stopped working

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.880
- since they started their company.
- Mai!

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.560
I'm being very serious about this.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.920
You need something
to bring you luck in your office!

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.040
Well, I have you!

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.400
So, they've been trying
to find their work-life balance.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360
- Alright,
- Hm?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.640
let's review our agreement again.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.920
No phones until the movie ends.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.040
- Mai, didn't you put it on silent?
- Hm?

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.560
That's not my phone.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.120
Well...

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.920
It's probably very important, you know?

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.080
Like I said...
They are trying.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.000
- Wait...
- It's them!

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.760
- It's really them!
- Excuse me,

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.280
can we have a photo?

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.560
Please.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.760
Hurry!

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.680
As for Frank and Auer,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.880
though you were afraid
people would be against them dating...

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
No, I mean, with Frank, too.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.880
- Both of you.
- Yes!

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.720
- Alright.
- Please move closer together!

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.440
I guess you can relax now

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.080
since it's the other way around.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.040
As for your mom's flower shop,
Jake made it better than it already was.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.320
You were worried about her
doing everything on her own, right?

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.440
No need to worry now.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.320
Whoa, it's 350 baht?

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.000
For such a small bouquet?!

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.640
Can't you just give me a discount?
I'm a regular.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.360
Even though it's small,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.240
each flower you see
was very hard to tend.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.200
If you're a regular,
shouldn't you be more understanding?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.840
Patty,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.000
as you can see,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.240
grew up to be just like her sister.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.680
She's not the same
Scaredy Patty anymore.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.520
Woo, Patty!

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.000
Can't fall asleep?

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.960
Mm...

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.040
My heart's still racing
from everything you told me.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.360
I didn't know
things could change this dramatically

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.360
within just three years.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.200
Right?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.840
Speaking of three years ago,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.600
it reminds me
of when we switched bodies.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.760
It was like
the wildest dream, wasn't it?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.600
Mm...

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.840
I think I now understand

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.840
why the Mysterious Person

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.040
called us the Moon and the Star.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.320
Why?

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.560
Well,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:16.440
when the moon and the stars reunite,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.720
the sky looks
even more captivating than usual.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.080
But if the moon appears
without the stars,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.000
the sky seems oddly lonesome.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.640
If the stars appear without the moon,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.520
the sky doesn't feel complete, either.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.360
How pretty.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.040
I'll take a picture of it.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.320
Print!

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520
It's now 11:11 P.M.,

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.760
make a wish!

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.400
I wish to be with Print
every day from now on.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.240
Your wish will come true

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.040
from this second onward.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.560
Will you marry me?

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.040
Why are you stealing my thunder?

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.480
- Yes, I will.
- Yes, I will.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.680
Thank you.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.480
I don't know

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.880
how we ended up here.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.960
From rivals to friends,

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.800
and from friends to lovers.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.320
I don't know if it's destiny

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.640
or the moon and the stars

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.480
guiding our way to each other.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.880
But I'm thankful

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.200
for your love

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.000
and your understanding.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.600
You make me realize the definition

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.080
of "You are me,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.200
I am you.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.720
We are bound by the souls."

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.360
And no matter what happens,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.320
you'll never have
to go through it alone

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.880
because I'll never leave your side.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.120
I love you, Rey.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.080
From this day forth,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.680
we're not rivals anymore;

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.480
we are the same person.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.640
Print!

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.440
Remember: whoever's hand is on top

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.600
during the cake cutting
will be the family's matriarch.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.280
Rey,

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.200
don't let your hands be under hers.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.000
You don't like
the taste of peace, do you?

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.320
- Argh!
- Whoa, whoa!

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.120
Can we have
a non-chaotic day just for once?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.240
Well, who started?

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.080
Kiss! Kiss!

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.400
Kiss! Kiss!

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.560
Kiss! Kiss!

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.640
Kiss! Kiss!

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680
Kiss!

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.120
- So sweet!
- That's right!

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.080
Be loving, you two.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.520
Cheers!

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.840
Do you want some more?

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.080
Father, cheers.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.960
I'll get it for you

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.440
and even feed you.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.520
Dear, would you like some cake?

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.440
Want some?

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.240
Okay.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.720
Let me touch up your face,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.160
dear brother!

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.480
Print!

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.000
Get a good aim this way.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.240
Rey, throw it this way.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.360
- This way!
- This way.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400
- This way!
- This way.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.240
I said this way!!

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.800
I'll go take a shower, then.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960
Hold on there.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.880
I haven't had a bite of my cake yet.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.080
There's still some here.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.240
Want a taste?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.800
Mm.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.600
Back then, you said

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.080
you were so into me

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.000
that you didn't see only yourself.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.120
So...who do you see now?

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.440
I see...

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.400
you, Rey.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.960
I also see you, Print.
