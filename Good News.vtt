00:16.391 --> 00:21.146
INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

00:21.229 --> 00:26.026
BUT ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS PORTRAYED
ARE FICTIONAL

00:27.402 --> 00:31.448
WHAT IS THE TRUTH THEN?

00:32.032 --> 00:36.244
"Sometimes the truth
lies on the far side of the moon."

00:36.327 --> 00:40.040
"But that doesn't mean
what's on the near side is fiction."

00:40.749 --> 00:42.167
By Truman Shady.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.712
Come on! Haven't you heard that one?

00:45.795 --> 00:47.172
Of course I have!

00:47.964 --> 00:50.341
There could be all kinds
of bullshit happening in the dark,

00:50.425 --> 00:51.801
but people only believe what they see.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.763
And that becomes the truth,
like the news.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.140
Maybe it's the moon making you talk crap.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.101
No matter which side you look at,
it's still the moon.

01:00.185 --> 01:03.188
You're the one barking nonsense, not me!

01:04.272 --> 01:06.357
Are you calling me a dog?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.317
She's here.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.864
Thank you for coming at such a late hour.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.825
Oh, you're even more beautiful in person.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.078
Here are two pieces of news.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.370
The first one is…

01:19.454 --> 01:21.873
Sixty-six days ago, an aircraft flying
a domestic route

01:21.956 --> 01:23.416
was hijacked by the puppet army's spies…

01:23.500 --> 01:25.543
ANNIHILATE THE US IMPERIALISTS!

01:25.627 --> 01:28.088
…and 51 of our citizens
were abducted to North Korea.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.714
And today, 66 days on…

01:29.798 --> 01:31.216
FEBRUARY 14, 1970
IMJIN RIVER, SOUTH KOREA

01:31.299 --> 01:35.011
…39 passengers
were finally returned to freedom.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.264
However, the remaining 12 passengers are
still being held hostage in North Korea

01:38.348 --> 01:40.433
and are unable to return.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.396
They locked us up one by one

01:45.480 --> 01:47.899
and then subjected us
to brutal electrical torture.

01:48.399 --> 01:51.611
One of the men lost his mind…

01:51.694 --> 01:53.404
And the second piece of news.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.324
MARCH 15, 1970
TOKYO, JAPAN

01:56.407 --> 01:58.535
Today in Komagome, Toshima, Tokyo,

01:58.618 --> 02:01.663
the leader of the Red Army Faction,
a violent extremist anti-government group,

02:01.746 --> 02:03.623
Tadashi Yamamoto,
has finally been arrested.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.919
The Red Army Faction is the most violent
anti-government Communist group,

02:08.002 --> 02:12.423
and has partaken in the Tokyo University
struggle in the past.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.468
They have armed themselves
with weapons and homemade bombs

02:15.552 --> 02:19.639
and evolved into a terrorist organization.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.226
Revolution!

02:23.726 --> 02:26.479
These two pieces of news
were from different countries

02:26.563 --> 02:28.273
and had little in common.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.275
Until recently.

02:31.109 --> 02:34.237
Correlations can be drawn
and erased just as easily.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.906
All it takes is a bit of creativity

02:37.574 --> 02:40.368
and the willingness to suspend disbelief.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.955
GOOD NEWS

02:45.165 --> 02:48.376
We found this among your belongings.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.004
What does it mean?

02:57.427 --> 03:00.430
I'm not that familiar with English.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.018
What does that say?

03:05.101 --> 03:08.062
And the third piece of news starts here.

03:10.565 --> 03:16.738
MARCH 31, 1970
HANEDA AIRPORT, JAPAN

03:26.122 --> 03:27.332
Relax.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.125
We're Ashita no Joe.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.672
We're Ashita no Joe.

03:35.548 --> 03:39.344
Back then, there were no metal detectors
or security screenings.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.430
From that day on,
all of that became mandatory.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.141
You could say these nine lunatics

03:45.225 --> 03:48.645
contributed toward improving
Japan's aviation security systems.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.605
Go ahead, please.

03:50.688 --> 03:51.648
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:51.731 --> 03:56.945
welcome aboard Japanese Ride Flight 351
headed to Itazuke.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.364
We'll be departing shortly,

03:59.447 --> 04:01.366
so please fasten your seat belts.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.577
Try opening the top and then pulling it.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.792
It's an honor to fly with you, Captain.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.337
What's wrong?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.506
Shouldn't you be smiling today?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.674
Why?

04:17.757 --> 04:20.510
You're about to hit 10,000 flight hours.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.928
How does it feel?

04:23.179 --> 04:24.180
Painful.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.765
What?

04:25.848 --> 04:28.893
Spending 10,000 hours in this tiny seat

04:28.977 --> 04:30.520
has exacerbated my hemorrhoids.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.647
Are they that bad?

04:32.730 --> 04:34.107
Malignant.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.402
If it was cancer, it'd be terminal.

04:38.611 --> 04:43.950
It's a shame that it's too intimate
for you to show off.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.952
Why would I show them off?

04:46.828 --> 04:49.914
They're more like a medal of honor.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.293
I bet your hemorrhoids
want to scream out loud,

04:53.376 --> 04:58.256
"I am the result of 10,000 flight hours!"

05:01.217 --> 05:03.136
Preflight checklist.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.887
Preflight checklist.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.399
Ma'am.

05:16.899 --> 05:20.570
Would you like me to store your bag
to give you more legroom?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.407
Look.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.786
Do you get paid extra

05:29.662 --> 05:31.414
if you fake a smile like that?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.208
My apologies.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.569
I remember now.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.577
HJ stands for…

06:14.374 --> 06:16.084
Hijack!

06:16.167 --> 06:18.461
CHAPTER 1
HIJACKING

06:29.514 --> 06:30.807
Keep your heads down!

06:36.354 --> 06:38.022
Shut up!

06:42.318 --> 06:43.361
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:43.444 --> 06:46.364
there has been a minor interruption
on the flight.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.034
We apologize for any inconvenience
this may cause.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.329
Allow us to formally introduce ourselves.

06:55.665 --> 07:00.461
We are a Communist League
called the Red Army Faction.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.882
Hello. I'm Shinichi Ishida,
the deputy minister of Transport.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.260
Today, Japan has…

07:07.927 --> 07:12.014
ended up with what Marx called
high capitalism.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.517
The Expo '70 showcases

07:14.600 --> 07:18.521
Japan's rapidly progressing economy…

07:18.604 --> 07:20.189
We hereby declare!

07:21.482 --> 07:26.112
In order to crush
bourgeois capitalist power,

07:26.195 --> 07:28.531
we came to a conclusion
that there is no other option

07:28.614 --> 07:30.491
but armed revolution.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.619
The decision must have been
difficult to make.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.372
Will you be attending
the opening ceremony?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.957
Of course. And…

07:42.295 --> 07:44.380
-Mr. Ishida?
-Yes, I will be attending.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.257
The Ministry of Transport has a lot--

07:48.509 --> 07:53.806
Well, that's live TV for you,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.600
-We apologize for--
-Fuck!

07:55.683 --> 07:56.767
Those bastards!

07:58.769 --> 07:59.812
Dear viewers!

07:59.896 --> 08:00.938
Where are they headed?

08:01.022 --> 08:02.231
Pyongyang?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.693
Did you just say Pyongyang?

08:06.194 --> 08:09.614
Does it look like we're going
on a Hawaiian vacation?

08:10.239 --> 08:13.701
We're not doing this to go hula dancing!

08:14.410 --> 08:16.329
We're going to build a military base.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.789
Do you even know what North Korea's like?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.418
Of course we do.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.088
And yet you're still taking
all those people with you?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.924
Don't you know what will happen to them?

08:28.549 --> 08:29.675
Unfortunately,

08:30.176 --> 08:32.887
some sacrifice
is inevitable in a revolution.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.306
Every one of us is prepared to die.

08:41.270 --> 08:45.358
And if anyone gets in our way…

08:49.070 --> 08:51.113
we're ready to kill them.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.451
As long as we can get to Pyongyang…

08:57.411 --> 08:58.663
we will do

08:59.580 --> 09:01.123
whatever it takes.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.879
A little to the left.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.132
I do not know how to get to Pyongyang.

09:10.216 --> 09:15.429
No commercial Japanese aircraft has ever
entered North Korean airspace before.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.348
Wait.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.683
Maeda.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.769
You've been there, haven't you?

09:22.311 --> 09:23.229
What?

09:24.730 --> 09:27.441
I became a naturalized Japanese citizen
more than ten years ago.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.361
And my parents are from South Korea,
not the North.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.824
Then I suppose we have no other choice.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.785
Can't you just follow the radar?

09:37.868 --> 09:41.747
Ground control gives us orders,
go this way or that way.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.166
Do you know the radio frequency
for Pyongyang air traffic control?

09:46.627 --> 09:48.879
You don't know it?

09:48.963 --> 09:50.464
How on earth would we know it

09:50.548 --> 09:52.425
when we don't even have
any diplomatic ties to them?

09:52.508 --> 09:54.385
Next time you try hijacking,

09:55.344 --> 09:56.887
try doing your homework first.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.349
Stop! Stop it!

10:01.517 --> 10:03.644
That's enough! Pull yourself together.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.731
How will you get to Pyongyang
if you beat up the pilot, huh?

10:09.191 --> 10:10.359
My apologies.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.363
Let us be mindful of each other

10:15.072 --> 10:16.407
until we reach our destination.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.244
This is a domestic flight.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.872
We don't have enough fuel
to go to Pyongyang.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.791
We need to land at Itazuke
as planned and refuel--

10:25.875 --> 10:28.210
What bullshit
are you pulling now, old man?

10:33.549 --> 10:34.967
You know, actually…

10:36.177 --> 10:38.638
I think one pilot is plenty.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.809
But the fuel isn't.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.775
Later, I saw on the news

10:50.858 --> 10:53.778
that they actually had enough fuel, but…

10:55.738 --> 10:56.822
What else could they do?

10:57.823 --> 11:01.160
The hijackers had no clue
what or where the fuel gauge was.

11:01.869 --> 11:05.414
And the brave pilots used that
to their advantage.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.832
FUEL GAUGE

11:06.916 --> 11:08.292
STILL FULL

11:11.462 --> 11:14.298
ITAZUKE TOWER

11:14.382 --> 11:17.551
Requesting to land as scheduled
at Itazuke for fuel.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.346
They are arriving in 20 minutes!
Are the riot police unit on their way?

11:27.269 --> 11:29.105
The hijackers demand the following.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.024
The Self-Defense Forces and the police

11:32.108 --> 11:35.069
must not approach the aircraft
while it's refueling.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.364
After refueling,
we'll head straight to Pyongyang.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.949
So we demand a map and a compass.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.828
The hijackers have liquid explosives.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.163
If their demands aren't met,

11:47.581 --> 11:49.500
they're threatening to detonate them.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.531
Damn it! I knew they'd do this!

12:20.614 --> 12:23.492
The riot police units are everywhere!
Brace for a shootout!

12:23.576 --> 12:25.369
Bring the hostages over!

12:25.453 --> 12:26.787
Nobody move!

12:26.871 --> 12:28.581
Please don't kill us!

12:30.374 --> 12:31.709
Be quiet!

12:38.632 --> 12:41.135
Take one step closer,
and we'll kill them all!

12:44.430 --> 12:47.099
If they open fire, we respond!

12:47.683 --> 12:50.227
We won't back down to capitalist pigs!

12:52.271 --> 12:54.231
Our plan is as follows.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.443
First, Team A will puncture the wheels.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.029
Then lower the rear airstairs--

13:00.112 --> 13:01.655
Hold on. Isn't that the front?

13:03.574 --> 13:04.700
Is it the front?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.335
Oh, it is!

13:14.418 --> 13:17.463
This looks more like a sausage with wings!

13:20.299 --> 13:21.884
Who the hell drew this?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.637
Who the hell drew this?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.430
-Step forward!
-That's enough.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.307
Estimated casualties?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.727
I'd say anywhere from five

13:31.811 --> 13:35.272
to a hundred, give or take.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.610
That range is too wide.

13:39.693 --> 13:40.903
Everyone.

13:42.905 --> 13:48.202
Why are there armed riot police units
on the runway?

13:48.285 --> 13:53.123
Not a single life will be lost
on my aircraft.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.375
Mr. Chairman.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.754
While I admire your noble spirit
to put people's lives first,

13:58.838 --> 14:01.590
some sacrifice is inevitable
in order to wipe out

14:01.674 --> 14:03.008
the anti-state communist forces.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.011
"Some sacrifice"?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.430
-You.
-Yes, sir.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.475
What is our airline's slogan?

14:11.559 --> 14:15.271
"As safe as a house in the sky," sir.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.940
Sometimes,

14:18.023 --> 14:20.401
people do die at home…

14:22.152 --> 14:24.405
You little bastard!

14:26.866 --> 14:29.368
And if they do,
house prices drop, don't they?

14:30.119 --> 14:33.581
If our revenue drops,
will the JSDF take responsibility for it?

14:34.248 --> 14:38.168
Or will the government
take responsibility?

14:38.252 --> 14:41.171
Have all forces stand down immediately
and refuel the plane.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.924
Or else we'll detonate the bomb
and blow everyone up!

14:44.675 --> 14:47.428
This airport is under the jurisdiction
of the US Armed Forces,

14:47.511 --> 14:49.221
so refueling will take some time.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.807
Let the passengers go first,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.601
and we'll talk to the US military.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.394
I'll give you one hour.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.937
We, the Red Army Faction,

14:57.438 --> 15:00.941
are not afraid to make sacrifices
for a successful revolution! We are…

15:02.192 --> 15:03.485
Ashita no Joe.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.864
Ashita no Joe?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.325
What on earth is that?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.201
Isn't it a manga series?

15:11.285 --> 15:14.455
Yes, sir. It was published in 1968

15:15.164 --> 15:17.249
and written by Asao Takamori
and Tetsuya Chiba.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.544
The main character is a boxer
named Joe Yabuki.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.880
A famous quote from the series is,

15:22.963 --> 15:26.508
"Even if it's for a moment,
I'll burn, blindingly bright and red."

15:27.217 --> 15:28.594
"Then in the end,

15:28.677 --> 15:31.347
all that will remain
is a pile of white ashes."

15:34.475 --> 15:37.019
Just how old are those damn Reds?

15:50.407 --> 15:52.826
Firstly, I would like to apologize.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.413
If this bomb does go off,

15:56.497 --> 15:58.123
it won't be seen as our doing

15:58.874 --> 16:02.670
but as a massacre by capitalist Japan
who forced our hand.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.341
I'm sorry.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.551
Wait a second.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.430
Is that coming towards us?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.528
What are they doing?

16:30.698 --> 16:32.574
I'm sure the government

16:33.492 --> 16:35.995
knows what they're doing.

16:36.787 --> 16:37.871
What is that?

16:37.955 --> 16:40.040
Why's there a fighter jet approaching now?

16:40.124 --> 16:42.251
Get them on the radio immediately!

16:47.923 --> 16:49.425
Who the heck authorized this?

16:50.050 --> 16:51.218
It wasn't me, sir.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.178
I gave the order, sir!

16:53.262 --> 16:54.304
What?

16:54.388 --> 16:58.600
As a member of the Self-Defense Forces,
I can't just stand by and watch!

16:58.684 --> 17:01.812
What are you going to do
if it results in casualties?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.027
That won't happen, sir.

17:13.907 --> 17:14.950
What's happening?

17:48.317 --> 17:49.485
What is he going to do?

17:50.944 --> 17:53.322
It looks like
he's just getting off the plane.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.040
Did he just…

18:04.124 --> 18:06.502
double park the plane and run?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.838
Do you know how annoying it is

18:09.922 --> 18:13.509
when someone parks in front of you
and runs off when you're in a rush?

18:13.592 --> 18:17.971
Move that fighter jet right now,
or I'll blow a head off every ten minutes!

18:21.350 --> 18:24.061
Don't look at them like they're pathetic.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.022
We weren't much different back then.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.650
KOREAN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

18:29.733 --> 18:32.277
No. Unless His Excellency
directly orders it…

18:32.361 --> 18:33.695
CHIEF OF STAFF, ROK AIR FORCE

18:33.779 --> 18:36.156
…the Air Force will follow
proper protocol.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.368
Chief of Staff Choi!

18:42.204 --> 18:44.665
Why is he suddenly being so uncooperative?

18:44.748 --> 18:47.876
I heard the Air Force is siding with Kim,
the president's chief of staff.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.128
Looks like it's true.

18:59.429 --> 19:04.601
Now, what pressing national issue
brought all of you gentlemen together?

19:05.394 --> 19:06.228
Who is that?

19:06.311 --> 19:08.772
I'm a nobody, so you can
just call me Nobody.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.232
Hey, Nobody.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.402
-How have you been?
-Doing well, thanks.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.280
You've been briefed, yes?

19:17.281 --> 19:18.657
What do you think?

19:18.740 --> 19:22.202
Japs kidnapping a bunch of other Japs
to go to North Korea? Just say "sayonara."

19:22.286 --> 19:24.997
“Japs”? Watch your mouth!

19:25.080 --> 19:26.790
Oh, excuse my potty mouth.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.500
You see, during colonial rule,

19:28.584 --> 19:32.796
my grandpa used to live two houses over
from an independence activist.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.885
Didn't you say that your grandpa
ratted him out to the Japanese police?

19:37.968 --> 19:40.637
Come on, that's a painful part
of my family history.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.975
Anyway, Japan, North Korea…
other countries' problems, not ours.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.770
There are no borders
when it comes to people's lives.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.480
This is about human rights.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.401
Human rights from the KCIA?
Well, that's new.

19:59.364 --> 20:03.285
So wait, is this from the top?

20:03.368 --> 20:06.788
His Excellency has important duties
to attend to today.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.542
I'll be briefing him on it later
like a surprise gift.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.008
Anyway, I received some intel
from the US CIA.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.303
The situation doesn't look good here, sir.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.472
If Japan fucks up,

20:24.598 --> 20:27.893
it is possible that the aircraft
will pass through South Korean airspace.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.854
Requesting immediate notification
up the chain, sir.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.232
I can see where the US is coming from.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.943
If they want to keep the Soviets in check,

20:36.026 --> 20:38.612
they'd want us to be chummy with Japan.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.991
But what is Japan doing right now?

20:43.075 --> 20:47.871
The fighter jet that blocked Haru
on the runway is being pulled out.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.082
Fighter jets can't reverse

20:50.165 --> 20:53.210
so they're towing it out with a truck.

20:54.127 --> 20:58.548
So we're fixing this mess
to rub the Japs' faces in it

20:58.632 --> 21:02.719
and kiss the Yankees' asses?

21:02.803 --> 21:04.346
Who the heck is this guy?

21:06.848 --> 21:09.017
Yes, what is it?

21:11.395 --> 21:16.525
How many times do I have to tell you?
Those men have to be Reds!

21:16.608 --> 21:18.402
What? Evidence?

21:21.738 --> 21:23.448
Give me two weeks.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.659
All right.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.660
Goodness.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.203
So here's the thing.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.665
Once they go over to North Korea
with the airplane and passengers,

21:31.748 --> 21:35.585
they'll use them to negotiate with Japan.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.629
But!

21:38.130 --> 21:41.550
Think about what will happen
if they ask for economic aid.

21:41.633 --> 21:45.637
Then the GDP of the Reds in the North

21:45.721 --> 21:47.764
will grow and surpass ours.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.101
Just hearing that
makes my blood sugar drop.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.645
But what if…

21:54.229 --> 21:58.775
we take matters into our own hands
and fix this mess for them?

21:59.276 --> 22:00.694
If we do,

22:00.777 --> 22:04.698
then Japan will owe us a big favor!

22:04.781 --> 22:08.785
And we can wave our flag proudly
on the global stage.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.209
It's sure to please His Excellency.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.296
And the Blue House Chief of Staff
will be green with envy.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.384
All right, to sum up…

22:25.427 --> 22:27.804
If Japan fails, as we predicted,

22:27.888 --> 22:33.268
the lunatics, armed with explosives,
head to North Korea with 130 hostages.

22:33.352 --> 22:37.189
And our mission
is to appease those lunatics,

22:37.272 --> 22:40.400
who will be floating in the air.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.113
How do you propose we do that?

22:45.697 --> 22:47.115
By talking to them?

22:49.451 --> 22:51.536
Thank you for your valuable input.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.456
The fact of the matter is, sir,
it simply cannot be done.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.383
We'll have a moment, if you please.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.809
Come on, brother.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.561
It really can't be done?

23:18.146 --> 23:24.069
If I tell you I want to walk on water,
your job is to freeze that water solid.

23:25.987 --> 23:26.905
I mean,

23:28.031 --> 23:30.534
it's not like I'm a magician.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.661
But if you do work some magic,

23:33.495 --> 23:37.874
I could do what my dad couldn't do
and make your wish come true.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.423
Go on,

23:44.506 --> 23:46.258
pull a dove out of your hat for me.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.598
I thought you might
get angry if you heard it…

23:53.682 --> 23:55.475
What? No way.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.104
I have no anger in me.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.065
Go ahead and tell me.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.280
You idiot!

24:08.363 --> 24:11.074
Are you trying to get me killed?

24:11.158 --> 24:13.410
That's unacceptable. That just isn't okay.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.703
How could you…

24:17.914 --> 24:18.999
Shut up!

24:19.082 --> 24:20.375
Put your gun away!

24:20.959 --> 24:22.836
You're scaring the baby!

24:25.922 --> 24:26.756
Sir!

24:26.840 --> 24:27.966
-Are you all right?
-Shut up!

24:28.049 --> 24:29.843
-What is it over there?
-Stewardess!

24:29.926 --> 24:32.429
-Come over here! Quick!
-What is it? Huh?

24:32.971 --> 24:33.889
I…

24:34.556 --> 24:36.183
I have a heart condition.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.352
You should've mentioned that
before you got kidnapped!

24:39.436 --> 24:40.562
Pardon?

24:42.105 --> 24:44.065
Untie him right now!

24:45.066 --> 24:47.861
Is there a doctor on board?

24:47.944 --> 24:49.613
-Any doctors?
-Is there--

24:49.696 --> 24:50.697
I'm…

24:51.281 --> 24:52.407
a doctor!

24:52.491 --> 24:54.367
A medical emergency has occurred on board.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.369
Please start refueling the plane.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.247
We are still in discussion
with the US Armed Forces.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.666
Wait a few more minutes.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.294
Please hurry…

25:04.377 --> 25:05.712
If the passenger dies,

25:05.795 --> 25:08.256
just know that
it's all the government's fault!

25:09.549 --> 25:10.467
Hey!

25:12.802 --> 25:14.387
-Fuck.
-Hello?

25:14.471 --> 25:15.514
Hey!

25:15.597 --> 25:19.267
Tell them that you'll free the sick
and elderly in exchange for fuel.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.312
I'm sure you don't want
to see anyone die either.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.567
We won't be making any deals
with capitalist pigs.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.445
If anything happens
to a passenger on board,

25:30.529 --> 25:32.113
then you will be giving

25:32.614 --> 25:36.618
those capitalist pigs
an excuse to charge in here.

25:39.454 --> 25:40.580
It's a yes from me.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.751
We'll still have enough hostages
even without the sick and elderly.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.218
It's five to three.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.678
We should hurry and let them--

25:54.761 --> 25:56.346
It's a no from me.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.306
One compromise will open the floodgates.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.693
Four to four.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.283
Actually, I've changed my mind.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.200
What?

26:17.284 --> 26:19.911
We have to stand our ground
until we reach Pyongyang!

26:19.995 --> 26:21.955
That's five to three. No one gets off!

26:22.038 --> 26:22.914
No.

26:24.249 --> 26:28.920
Communism calls for a unanimous decision.

26:29.879 --> 26:33.008
We don't follow things like majority rule.

26:37.512 --> 26:40.056
Wait, Leader.
Then why did you call for a vote--

26:40.140 --> 26:41.308
Shut up!

26:41.391 --> 26:42.726
The leader makes the call.

26:43.977 --> 26:44.853
Right?

26:47.480 --> 26:48.815
Of course.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.360
Dictatorship in communism is inevitable.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.405
Japanese Ride Flight 351

26:55.488 --> 26:58.241
has finally begun refueling
after a four-hour standoff.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.995
With much effort and persistent persuasion
from government authorities,

27:02.078 --> 27:03.913
23 passengers were released,

27:03.997 --> 27:05.999
including a patient
with a heart condition,

27:06.082 --> 27:09.169
the elderly, women and children.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.046
My son is still on board!

27:11.129 --> 27:12.631
The Japanese Self-Defense Forces

27:12.714 --> 27:16.217
prioritized the passengers'
lives and safety above all.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.764
We worked tirelessly
to safely rescue the passengers

27:20.847 --> 27:22.515
according to proper protocol.

27:22.599 --> 27:23.892
Hurry up. Close the door!

27:25.143 --> 27:28.688
However, it seems that
the remaining 106 passengers

27:28.772 --> 27:31.983
will be departing Itazuke Airport soon.

27:34.277 --> 27:35.487
Are you kidding me?

27:36.237 --> 27:37.864
I'm supposed to go to Pyongyang with this?

27:40.950 --> 27:42.369
Is there a problem?

27:43.119 --> 27:47.082
Aeronautical charts must have
flight routes and airport information.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.627
They clearly ripped this
out of a middle-school textbook.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.172
I wish you the best of luck.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.008
Hold on. Wait a second.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.760
Hey! Stop right there!

27:58.843 --> 27:59.803
Hey!

28:00.345 --> 28:01.262
Hey!

28:02.972 --> 28:06.101
Do you still think
this government has a plan?

28:06.601 --> 28:08.603
But why would they…

28:08.687 --> 28:13.024
They can't send us to North Korea
but they can't stop us from going either.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.653
So they're leaving us
to fend for ourselves.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.157
Despite everything,

28:21.741 --> 28:23.618
we did our best.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.914
"Our best"?

28:28.748 --> 28:30.333
What did we even do?

28:31.334 --> 28:33.795
All we did was double park
and piss them off!

28:36.214 --> 28:38.550
You all just stood there
and stared like idiots!

28:39.134 --> 28:40.969
Why is nobody furious about this?

28:41.052 --> 28:42.095
Excuse us!

28:51.271 --> 28:54.107
CHAPTER 2
DOUBLE HIJACKING

28:54.774 --> 28:55.817
Since the armistice,

28:55.900 --> 28:58.903
we've lost four US fighter jets
in North Korean airspace

28:58.987 --> 29:01.322
and incurred dozens of casualties.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.992
But last year, there was a team
that made it back safely,

29:04.075 --> 29:06.202
surviving an attack by North Korean MiGs.

29:06.286 --> 29:09.205
And the pilot who completed
the mission received a medal.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.123
But…

29:11.666 --> 29:14.043
why does only the pilot
receive the medal?

29:14.961 --> 29:17.380
Ask the person handing them out, not me.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.798
Well, look at you!

29:18.882 --> 29:20.884
You've got some sass, huh?

29:21.676 --> 29:25.096
You were the only Korean
in that mission, weren't you?

29:25.180 --> 29:26.931
As an assistant controller.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.353
Per the rule,
the lead controller of RAPCON

29:32.437 --> 29:34.314
should be from the US military.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.316
I see. By the way,

29:37.442 --> 29:38.777
I heard that the number of people

29:38.860 --> 29:41.821
who passed the RAPCON assessment
in Korea

29:43.156 --> 29:45.283
can be counted on one hand.

29:45.825 --> 29:46.701
Isn't that right?

29:53.750 --> 29:57.128
I'm probably the first finger
on that hand.

30:01.966 --> 30:02.967
Impressive.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.054
What exactly is RAPCON, anyway?

30:06.137 --> 30:08.389
RAPCON, or Radar Approach Control.

30:08.473 --> 30:12.602
State-of-the-art radar control system
held by the US since 1968.

30:12.685 --> 30:15.104
It's controlled
by a US 5th Air Force battalion

30:15.188 --> 30:17.106
and can detect
up to 30,000 ft. in the air--

30:17.190 --> 30:18.024
Enough.

30:18.608 --> 30:19.692
It's boring.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.612
In the end, you're just an assistant.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.576
And who exactly are you?

30:29.911 --> 30:32.789
I'm a nobody, just a shit-ass nobody.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.625
You can just call me Nobody.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.966
Am I understanding this correctly?

30:43.049 --> 30:46.511
This so-called Red Army Faction
hijacked the plane,

30:47.679 --> 30:50.598
so we're going to hijack
the airplane's radio.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.892
Isn't it fucking genius?

30:53.434 --> 30:54.727
I think so too.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.857
You have no idea
how this system works, do you?

30:58.940 --> 31:02.694
The controllers can't initiate
communication with the pilots.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.696
But you're going to make it happen.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.739
Since you know the system so well.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.033
Let's say we get in contact with them.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.911
How will we persuade them?

31:12.620 --> 31:13.872
By talking to them?

31:18.251 --> 31:20.128
What a genius.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.713
Cut me some slack.

31:21.796 --> 31:25.383
I had no time to prep, either.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.844
"By failing to prepare,

31:27.927 --> 31:30.430
you are preparing to fail."

31:31.389 --> 31:33.099
Benjamin Franklin.

31:33.975 --> 31:37.896
Yet another bastard
who's obsessed with quotes and shit.

31:37.979 --> 31:41.983
There's value in the words
of those remembered by history.

31:45.653 --> 31:49.282
KIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

31:54.871 --> 31:56.706
You speak Japanese, too, right?

31:57.749 --> 32:01.461
If this goes well,
I'll make your wish come true.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.047
Are you a mind reader?

32:05.173 --> 32:07.050
What do you think my wish is?

32:09.052 --> 32:10.678
Success.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.018
How shallow do you think I am?

32:19.437 --> 32:21.773
Your name means "making yourself known"?

32:21.856 --> 32:24.233
It's even in your fucking name.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.818
Excuse you, my father named me.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.195
Your father…

32:29.072 --> 32:30.907
Wasn't he a Korean War vet?

32:32.575 --> 32:33.493
WHITE HORSE HILL, 20 YEARS AGO

32:33.534 --> 32:36.162
The grenade went off at White Horse Hill.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.624
Have you ever seen
the puppet army's limbs fly?

32:40.291 --> 32:43.962
I was watching the spectacle in awe…

32:46.089 --> 32:48.675
when I realized that my legs flew off too.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.515
The person…

32:57.141 --> 33:00.144
who threw the grenade,
my lieutenant colonel,

33:01.187 --> 33:03.564
received
the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.859
Meanwhile…

33:09.153 --> 33:11.030
instead of two legs…

33:15.785 --> 33:18.121
your dad received this watch
from the president.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.999
Look. It's pretty nice, isn't it?

33:24.043 --> 33:25.586
If we pull this off,

33:26.295 --> 33:28.840
will the government
give me a medal or something?

33:28.923 --> 33:33.052
But of course!
You'll be living up to your name.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.182
Lieutenant Seo, who are these people?

33:38.266 --> 33:39.559
Just wait a sec.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.519
I'm about to walk them through
the procedure.

33:43.312 --> 33:47.025
As RAPCON is under US command,
even ministers need to receive clearance.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.361
Give me your ID,
and I'll get the process started.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.281
Tell him I really need
to use the restroom.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.742
This isn't some neighborhood café.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.326
Just interpret already.

34:02.707 --> 34:06.502
This guy has to pee badly
and wants to use our restroom.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.427
What the fuck was that?

34:15.428 --> 34:16.637
That's the code?

34:17.847 --> 34:20.767
So I get you're working
for the government,

34:21.434 --> 34:23.269
but what do you do, exactly?

34:23.352 --> 34:24.812
I told you, I'm just a nobody.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.022
That makes no sense.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.108
This is something
that could make the news.

34:36.240 --> 34:40.328
My work does appear on the news,
but I never do.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.872
So no need to know anything about me.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.249
Come on, there's no time to waste.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.857
-Sir!
-Sir!

35:11.317 --> 35:13.945
All right, the board's been set,

35:14.028 --> 35:15.738
so let's go!

35:20.868 --> 35:22.537
You are not serious, are you?

35:25.373 --> 35:28.334
You want me to be the…
the local controller?

35:29.335 --> 35:30.878
-All we can do…
-Now…

35:30.962 --> 35:35.258
How does it feel to have control
of South Korean airspace?

35:36.467 --> 35:37.635
Are you saying

35:37.718 --> 35:40.263
the US military is giving us
operational control?

35:40.888 --> 35:42.557
How does that even make sense?

35:42.640 --> 35:46.144
They're the ones who recommended you.

35:51.190 --> 35:54.443
This is clearly an unbelievable privilege.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.904
Which means the medal and promotion
aren't a bluff.

35:57.613 --> 36:00.366
It's a great opportunity
to make my mark in the world.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.493
But why?

36:02.577 --> 36:03.786
Why me, of all people?

36:03.870 --> 36:05.204
Quiet!

36:05.288 --> 36:07.582
I can hear your cogs whirring.
Just sit down.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.251
Everyone's in a mad rush right now.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.921
They left Itazuke 35 minutes ago
and are headed north over the East Sea.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.089
NORTH KOREA AIR FORCE HQ

36:15.173 --> 36:18.092
They're going to come straight
over South Korea?

36:19.093 --> 36:21.304
They sure are gutsy!

36:26.225 --> 36:28.186
They just have to make it over
the Demarcation Line.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.981
Then we'll have a Boeing 727
in our hands without breaking a sweat.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.861
On top of that, we'll have
about 100 lives to use for negotiation!

36:36.944 --> 36:40.489
Our Soviet comrades
will regard us highly for this.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.911
Get our most proficient
air traffic controller on the job!

36:48.164 --> 36:50.791
-He's the one who will carry out the plan.
-I see.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.070
In terms of range, RAPCON
covers a maximum radius of 40 miles.

37:19.153 --> 37:22.240
They have to radio us at least
in Kyonggi for us to track it.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.994
It's hard to intercept
transmissions to Pyongyang.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.538
Hey!

37:30.373 --> 37:32.750
40 miles, really?

37:37.129 --> 37:39.548
-Control, Range.
-Go ahead, Range.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.842
Permission to change
the controlling range.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.387
The control license number is…

37:47.098 --> 37:48.307
My license?

37:50.309 --> 37:51.560
You're fucking out of your mind.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.398
Going over 40 miles in range is
a violation of international aviation law.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.819
Are you trying to turn me
into an international criminal?

37:59.902 --> 38:03.030
Go ahead, Range.
Give us the control license.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.533
For fuck's sake.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.370
So this is why I'm sitting here?

38:11.163 --> 38:12.373
Major Hall.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.501
We, the United States of America,

38:15.584 --> 38:19.088
as the defenders of liberal democracy
around the world,

38:19.171 --> 38:24.635
firmly declare that we can never allow
the displacement of innocent civilians

38:24.719 --> 38:26.887
to a communist dictatorship.

38:27.596 --> 38:28.723
I agree, sir.

38:29.348 --> 38:31.100
So we command this operation?

38:31.183 --> 38:32.268
Major Hall.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.688
We, the United States of America,

38:35.771 --> 38:38.524
as the guardians of the rule of law,

38:38.607 --> 38:41.610
firmly declare that we can never violate

38:41.694 --> 38:44.363
any international aviation law.

38:46.699 --> 38:47.533
What the f…

38:48.367 --> 38:50.453
I can't do this. No, I will not do it.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.622
Sit.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.876
License number.

38:56.959 --> 39:00.171
8-2-9-0-7…

39:00.880 --> 39:02.882
1-4.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.009
Copy that.
We'll extend the controlling range

39:05.092 --> 39:06.802
to the maximum of 200 miles.

39:08.262 --> 39:09.930
Look! There's more stuff now.

39:10.473 --> 39:11.557
But how do we find "it"?

39:13.225 --> 39:15.936
What do you think you're doing?

39:17.229 --> 39:19.190
You guys all saw that, right?

39:19.273 --> 39:20.858
I didn't say it. This guy did it!

39:21.859 --> 39:23.778
Lieutenant Go-myung.

39:24.862 --> 39:25.821
Don't you want a medal?

39:25.905 --> 39:28.908
Not even a statue in my honor.
Cancel it immediately!

39:30.618 --> 39:34.663
More than 100 people
are being dragged off to North Korea.

39:34.747 --> 39:38.626
As a soldier and a controller,
don't you want to save those poor people?

39:39.710 --> 39:40.878
Damn it.

39:40.961 --> 39:42.713
-Go and sit back down!
-Shoot!

39:44.715 --> 39:46.509
I'm a soldier of the ROK Armed Forces,

39:46.592 --> 39:49.095
and I have not received
any official orders yet.

39:49.178 --> 39:52.431
Aren't all of you soldiers like me?

39:52.515 --> 39:54.558
This bastard's aiming a gun
at a ROK soldier.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.361
Have you eaten yet?

40:07.279 --> 40:11.534
No, I've been too busy to eat.
I'm starving. Yeah.

40:12.451 --> 40:15.704
Well, I got him in front of the panel,

40:16.705 --> 40:18.499
but he said something about aviation law.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.252
I don't know, but it's complicated.
My head hurts.

40:22.670 --> 40:23.879
Right. Sure.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.340
Take it.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.011
-Who is it?
-Hello.

40:31.637 --> 40:34.432
I'm Park Sang-hyeon,
the director of the KCIA.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.312
And who might you be?

40:40.813 --> 40:41.689
Yes, sir.

40:43.023 --> 40:46.277
COMSEC. I'm Lieutenant Seo Go-myung
of the 9th ACSG.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.736
Please proceed, sir.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.780
The Korean Central Intelligence Agency.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.491
Two things came to mind
the moment I heard that name.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.285
The moment I refuse…

40:58.747 --> 41:00.791
Commie, commie, red rat!

41:00.875 --> 41:04.336
…I'll be branded a Red
and live the rest of my life as a cripple.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.588
You little brats!

41:09.049 --> 41:11.802
Or be a snippet of news as a soldier
killed in a training accident.

41:13.012 --> 41:16.974
I don't know aviation law
or anything like that.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.227
Just do whatever it takes

41:20.311 --> 41:23.564
to land that plane nice and smoothly.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.776
Did you say,
"Just do whatever it takes," sir?

41:28.360 --> 41:29.361
Yes.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.697
Do whatever it takes.

41:38.996 --> 41:39.997
Then…

41:43.292 --> 41:44.293
Then…

41:46.795 --> 41:48.255
May I say this is North Korea?

41:50.049 --> 41:51.509
You bastard!

41:51.592 --> 41:54.970
And you call yourself a soldier
of the ROK Armed Forces, you asshole?

41:56.764 --> 42:00.309
You know you can be punished immediately
for what you just said, right?

42:09.193 --> 42:11.320
Put Nobody on the phone.

42:11.403 --> 42:15.950
See? I told you
that this was the only way.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.410
Yes, okay.

42:19.703 --> 42:20.663
Oh, yes. Yes, sure.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.707
Oh, sure. Yes. Yes.

42:25.167 --> 42:29.338
So then, the KCIA is authorizing it?

42:35.094 --> 42:39.640
Why are you standing there
like you have a stick up your ass?

42:39.723 --> 42:40.849
Aren't you going to work?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.435
Are you…

42:44.520 --> 42:47.189
Are you sure this is a good idea?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.775
Who gives a damn?

42:50.526 --> 42:53.946
If it all goes south,
we'll be eating our own words.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.492
Hey, soldiers, what are you waiting for?

42:58.576 --> 42:59.660
Follow me.

43:05.457 --> 43:07.209
Move it! We're running out of time!

43:07.293 --> 43:08.377
Yes, sir!

43:15.342 --> 43:16.927
Fuck.

43:17.553 --> 43:18.971
Where the heck are you?

43:20.389 --> 43:23.225
Thank you for your patience
and compliance.

43:23.309 --> 43:26.478
We are approaching Pyongyang,
so please bear with us a little bit more.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.148
As soon as we reach Pyongyang,

43:29.231 --> 43:34.111
we'll request that North Korea
returns all of you home safely.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.449
If you need to use the restroom,
please use it now.

43:40.200 --> 43:44.371
After the meal is over,
we'll be collecting all cigarettes.

43:44.455 --> 43:48.626
The collected cigarettes will be
shared equally among us over time.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.877
Hold on.

43:51.003 --> 43:54.757
I had three packs of Marlboro,
but he barely has a whole pack.

43:55.674 --> 43:57.468
Isn't it unfair to divvy them up equally?

43:58.218 --> 44:02.181
It's because of people like you that
we're trying to bring about a revolution.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.017
You keep talking about revolution.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.895
May I ask what
the goal of your revolution is?

44:07.978 --> 44:08.937
LONG LIVE LENINISM

44:09.021 --> 44:11.940
"Capitalism that only chases success

44:12.024 --> 44:14.193
will inevitably lead
to discrimination and submission

44:14.276 --> 44:16.153
and breed classism."

44:16.862 --> 44:19.448
We plan to overthrow
such established order

44:19.531 --> 44:22.076
and bring peace to the world.

44:22.910 --> 44:25.579
I heard them refer to you as the leader.

44:26.246 --> 44:28.749
But I guess
that doesn't count as classism.

44:28.832 --> 44:29.750
What?

44:30.250 --> 44:31.418
Anyway.

44:31.502 --> 44:35.214
You hijacked a plane, and now you plan
to organize an army in the name of peace?

44:35.297 --> 44:38.967
Peace doesn't necessarily
require peaceful means.

44:39.051 --> 44:40.427
Wow.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.971
That's some impressive logic.

44:44.014 --> 44:46.225
That almost persuaded me.

44:55.859 --> 44:58.821
Friendly 5-1-1, 0-9-5.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.030
I found it!

45:02.408 --> 45:04.034
What was the previous track?

45:04.118 --> 45:06.245
Friendly 510 was at 105,

45:06.328 --> 45:07.663
-108 miles--
-Okay!

45:07.746 --> 45:09.998
If we tracked them here and then here,

45:10.082 --> 45:12.292
that kind of speed
only comes from a fighter jet.

45:12.376 --> 45:15.295
Then that means
the Unknown 472 in front of them

45:15.379 --> 45:17.881
is the plane we're looking for!

45:17.965 --> 45:20.217
Oh! I get… What?

45:20.300 --> 45:21.677
-What?
-What?

45:21.760 --> 45:25.097
An unidentified aircraft invaded
our airspace illegally,

45:25.180 --> 45:28.392
so naturally, according to protocol,
we scrambled our fighter jets.

45:30.227 --> 45:33.772
But we shouldn't scramble
according to protocol.

45:36.442 --> 45:40.154
Does the Air Force
not know about this operation?

45:40.237 --> 45:41.196
Mr. Kim, sir.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.157
CHIEF OF STAFF, ROK AIR FORCE
FROM EARLIER

45:43.240 --> 45:44.658
Unless His Excellency directly orders it…

45:44.742 --> 45:48.370
Per protocol,
two fighter jets have been scrambled.

45:48.454 --> 45:52.207
They should've caught up
with it by now!

45:52.291 --> 45:53.417
Well done.

45:53.500 --> 45:56.378
You did an amazing job.
You did great.

45:56.462 --> 45:58.464
RESIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
CHIEF OF STAFF

45:59.256 --> 46:03.552
Having the head
of the ROK Air Force on my side

46:04.261 --> 46:07.306
is so reassuring, let me tell you.

46:08.557 --> 46:11.852
If I could be of any help to you,
I'll do all I can--

46:11.935 --> 46:13.020
"Splitting move."

46:13.604 --> 46:15.189
Oh, fuck!

46:16.815 --> 46:19.985
What's wrong, sir? Did I make a mistake?

46:20.068 --> 46:21.528
No, not at all.

46:21.612 --> 46:25.574
Anyway,
make their balls crawl back inside them

46:26.074 --> 46:28.744
and force them to land
at the nearest runway.

46:29.536 --> 46:32.706
What if they refuse to comply?

46:32.790 --> 46:36.668
Then what should we do?

46:37.753 --> 46:39.296
"Push and crush"!

46:39.379 --> 46:40.798
"Push and crush"…

46:42.132 --> 46:44.510
Are you saying we should shoot it down?

46:52.434 --> 46:53.602
What is that?

46:56.271 --> 46:57.439
What is that?

46:59.733 --> 47:02.569
-It's a South Korean fighter jet.
-South Korea?

47:02.653 --> 47:06.615
We must have veered off course.
Connect to the emergency frequency.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.330
This is the Korean Air Force.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.499
You made an intrusion in Korean airspace.

47:17.459 --> 47:19.586
State your call sign and destination.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.839
Japanese Ride 351.

47:21.922 --> 47:24.758
We are an unarmed
Japanese civilian aircraft.

47:24.842 --> 47:27.261
This is not our destination here.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.555
We are heading to Pyongyang Airport.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.307
You are intercepted by Korean Air Force.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.643
Descend and maintain 9,000.

47:35.269 --> 47:36.937
What are they saying?

47:39.064 --> 47:40.065
Follow me.

47:43.277 --> 47:44.486
I say again,

47:45.153 --> 47:47.656
you are intercepted by Korean Air Force.

47:49.199 --> 47:51.243
We don't allow you to go to Pyongyang.

47:51.326 --> 47:53.161
We don't allow you to go to Pyongyang.

47:53.245 --> 47:56.456
I say again,
we don't allow you to go to Pyongyang.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.708
Follow--

47:57.791 --> 47:58.834
What are you doing?

47:58.917 --> 48:00.669
What if we get shot down?

48:01.503 --> 48:03.380
If we can't set foot in Pyongyang,

48:03.964 --> 48:06.174
then dying in the sky isn't too bad.

48:10.846 --> 48:12.472
They've pulled back!

48:12.556 --> 48:13.557
But wait…

48:13.640 --> 48:15.225
They're in attack position.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.852
-Call the Osan base right now!
-Yes, sir!

48:17.644 --> 48:20.147
-No, no. Hey, Dopey.
-Sir?

48:20.230 --> 48:21.148
Go sit back down.

48:21.648 --> 48:23.817
-I--
-What do you think you're doing?

48:23.901 --> 48:25.777
This is a secret operation by the KCIA.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.362
Secret operation, my ass.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.822
What if there are casualties?

48:29.740 --> 48:31.700
Isn't this a rescue mission?

48:50.469 --> 48:52.596
Everyone, take your seats and buckle up!

48:53.388 --> 48:55.349
-Prepare for Plan B.
-Damn it!

49:13.075 --> 49:13.909
Come on.

49:16.870 --> 49:18.080
What are you doing?

49:18.163 --> 49:20.958
What was that… just now?

49:21.458 --> 49:23.669
I think it was a flock of geese.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.588
Lieutenant Go-myung.

49:26.672 --> 49:28.048
Don't get ahead of yourself.

49:28.131 --> 49:31.134
Attacking a Japanese commercial flight
is a declaration of war.

49:31.218 --> 49:33.095
What lunatic would do such a thing?

49:33.178 --> 49:34.304
What?

49:34.388 --> 49:35.889
They didn't respond?

49:36.765 --> 49:40.519
Those Reds are so rude,
no matter what nationality they are.

49:41.645 --> 49:44.106
If they refuse to land
before the Demarcation Line,

49:44.898 --> 49:46.108
then just turn back.

49:46.733 --> 49:47.609
"Cross"!

50:00.163 --> 50:00.998
Yes!

50:01.581 --> 50:02.624
They've turned back!

50:32.904 --> 50:33.780
Wait a second.

50:38.118 --> 50:40.787
If the Korean fighter jets
have turned back…

50:40.871 --> 50:43.832
It just crossed the MDL
and entered our airspace.

50:43.915 --> 50:45.292
All right, comrades!

50:45.375 --> 50:47.419
Our internationalist
revolutionary warriors

50:47.502 --> 50:49.546
are flying straight
into the Republic's arms!

50:50.714 --> 50:52.090
Open the emergency frequency.

50:53.091 --> 50:54.342
Now what?

50:54.426 --> 50:57.763
You said we can't
initiate communication from here.

50:57.846 --> 51:02.059
That's why Lieutenant Seo
opened the emergency frequency.

51:02.142 --> 51:06.063
When they try to radio again,
we'll intercept their transmission.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.106
But wait, what if they--

51:14.196 --> 51:16.656
What if they're
already talking to Pyongyang?

51:16.740 --> 51:18.033
You said they're headed straight to them.

51:18.116 --> 51:20.869
They probably won't know
Pyongyang's frequency.

51:20.952 --> 51:22.537
How the heck would you know?

51:23.121 --> 51:24.915
If they were under Pyongyang's control,

51:24.998 --> 51:28.376
they wouldn't have dared
to go through South Korea like that.

51:28.460 --> 51:31.171
They will end up using
the emergency frequency.

51:31.671 --> 51:34.966
The problem is that the emergency
frequency of 121.5 MHz is used worldwide,

51:35.050 --> 51:36.593
so anyone can listen in.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.386
Including Pyongyang.

51:38.470 --> 51:43.391
So the call won't come directly to us
but to an emergency contact? Is that it?

51:44.226 --> 51:47.604
Then are the South Koreans
listening in as well?

51:48.939 --> 51:51.441
Cat got your tongue? Answer us!

51:53.151 --> 51:55.904
My head's about to explode
from all the noise.

51:56.780 --> 51:58.365
Keep it down, all of you.

51:58.448 --> 51:59.866
You little ass--

52:00.951 --> 52:02.619
Without talking to a control tower,

52:02.702 --> 52:04.746
we might get swept away
or crash into a mountain.

52:04.830 --> 52:06.665
You said this frequency
was open to everyone.

52:07.457 --> 52:09.584
What if someone else listens in?

52:09.668 --> 52:12.504
Do you want to be aimlessly
flying in the sky forever?

52:16.133 --> 52:21.471
The elite controller face-off
between North and South Korea

52:23.306 --> 52:25.433
is simpler than it seems.

52:25.517 --> 52:26.351
No.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.353
It's not simple at all.

52:28.436 --> 52:32.524
This duel demands
extreme focus and speed.

52:32.607 --> 52:35.652
Amid the countless transmissions,
we have to locate Haru's call

52:35.735 --> 52:41.366
and press this red button
even just 0.0000000001 second faster.

52:41.449 --> 52:45.078
That's how you win
this solitary and nerve-wracking battle.

52:45.954 --> 52:48.456
So, to summarize,

52:50.959 --> 52:54.713
the person with the fastest hand wins.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.090
If I had to give an example…

52:58.175 --> 53:01.303
Like Clint Eastwood
in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.402
Is it connected?

54:00.487 --> 54:02.364
Listening. Go ahead.

54:16.127 --> 54:18.463
Wildfire extinguished!
Wildfire extinguished!

54:18.546 --> 54:20.090
Returning to headquarters.

54:23.218 --> 54:25.804
All firefighting helicopters,

54:26.805 --> 54:29.474
please refrain from using
the emergency frequency from now on.

54:29.557 --> 54:31.017
Oh, come on, man!

54:31.101 --> 54:33.895
We've always used it.
So let's keep it that way.

54:33.979 --> 54:36.523
The emergency frequency
is for emergencies only!

54:36.606 --> 54:39.359
Firefighting helicopters
are supposed to put out fires!

54:39.442 --> 54:42.028
That's not an emergency, you bastard!

54:43.196 --> 54:44.364
What a fool.

54:44.864 --> 54:48.326
That dumb South Korean controller

54:48.410 --> 54:51.621
is fighting with a firefighting
helicopter pilot right now.

54:52.872 --> 54:56.084
We'd expect nothing less
from a US imperialist pawn.

54:57.627 --> 55:00.380
Shouldn't they have reached out by now?

55:25.030 --> 55:27.574
Any station. This is Japanese Ride 351.

55:27.657 --> 55:29.492
This is Japanese Ride 351.

55:29.576 --> 55:32.329
We're asking for
Pyongyang approach control.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.416
Japanese Ride 351.

55:36.499 --> 55:38.168
Japanese Ride 351.

55:38.251 --> 55:39.836
-This is Pyongyang approach control.
-…Pyongyang.

55:39.919 --> 55:41.796
South Korea might listen to this.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.215
Your radio is very weak
and garbled on this frequency.

55:44.299 --> 55:45.967
-Go to…
-Change frequency to…

55:46.051 --> 55:46.926
…134.1.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.303
129.7.

55:48.386 --> 55:50.013
And follow my instructions.

56:03.818 --> 56:05.904
This is Japanese Ride 351.

56:07.364 --> 56:08.531
Frequency…

56:09.282 --> 56:10.742
134.1.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.997
Frequency 134.1.

56:19.709 --> 56:20.585
Over.

56:32.305 --> 56:34.557
This is Japanese Ride 351.

56:35.058 --> 56:38.144
Now on your frequency, 134.1.

56:40.063 --> 56:42.690
Japanese Ride 351.

56:42.774 --> 56:44.317
Radar contact.

56:44.401 --> 56:48.655
Fly heading 290 and maintain 9,000 ft.

56:50.198 --> 56:53.410
Fire surface-to-air missiles immediately
and draw them back!

56:53.493 --> 56:55.829
Do not shoot them down!
Just send a signal. Understood?

56:56.788 --> 56:57.747
Fire!

57:01.000 --> 57:02.001
What…

57:03.169 --> 57:04.212
is going on now?

57:15.557 --> 57:18.685
Explosive noise and light
detected on our route.

57:22.439 --> 57:24.566
This is for you guys, comrades.

57:24.649 --> 57:27.652
Welcome to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

57:30.405 --> 57:32.115
I see…

57:33.324 --> 57:36.077
So this is a cannon salute?

57:57.849 --> 57:59.142
Leader.

57:59.976 --> 58:04.856
Even North Korea's welcome
is revolutionary, isn't it?

58:07.692 --> 58:08.735
Yes.

58:21.789 --> 58:23.875
Congrats to you too, Captain.

58:23.958 --> 58:26.544
You hit 10,000 flight hours.

58:27.712 --> 58:30.882
I think my hemorrhoids
are peeking out more.

58:44.646 --> 58:47.899
Lieutenant Seo!
The world's greatest hijacker!

58:47.982 --> 58:50.485
To double hijack a plane
without setting foot in it?

58:50.568 --> 58:53.238
That's damn good, right?

58:55.365 --> 58:56.574
You saved a lot of lives, man.

58:56.658 --> 58:58.493
Yup. Thank you, sir.

58:59.244 --> 59:01.246
And you can get yourself
fucking cheeseburgers

59:01.329 --> 59:02.914
with the price of their lives.

59:05.792 --> 59:08.044
All right. Captain, stand by.

59:13.591 --> 59:17.095
Hey, can you stall for as long as you can
until they arrive at Kimpo?

59:18.221 --> 59:21.516
The mission succeeded.
You could at least give me some praise.

59:21.599 --> 59:24.435
Don't you know that quote?
"Success is not final."

59:24.519 --> 59:25.645
Winston Churchill.

59:26.187 --> 59:27.188
Right.

59:27.272 --> 59:28.439
Keep up the good work.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.109
Where do you keep disappearing to?

59:31.609 --> 59:33.069
What does it matter to you?

59:33.152 --> 59:35.905
If you don't see me, it means I'm working.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.499
CHAPTER 3
SANDCASTLE

59:46.583 --> 59:48.668
What about the US aircraft
on the runway?

59:48.751 --> 59:51.045
It's a nightmare trying
to get them all to take off,

59:51.129 --> 59:53.423
so we're trying to hide them away
as best we can.

59:53.506 --> 59:56.050
I don't think hiding them will do.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.431
Look at that. Are you going
to take your sweet time moving those?

01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:05.143
This isn't like parking cars, sir!

01:00:05.226 --> 01:00:06.311
Hey, mister!

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.772
You can't just pull the flag down
like that! It's all tangled!

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.984
Is the North Korean flag
really on its way?

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:15.862
Where do you even get hold
of a thing like that?

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:22.160
Cut! Cut!

01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:25.079
You call that acting?

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.874
That wasn't realistic at all!

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.834
-You can't just shoot--
-Sir! Sir!

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.337
Someone wants to see you.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:37.342
Who the hell is ordering
the director around on set?

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:38.926
Come out!

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:43.848
There we go!

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.977
Now, this is what I call realistic!
You know?

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.981
But weren't we filming
the Korean Army scene tomorrow?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:55.234
I'm sure it's realistic
because they're real soldiers.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:14.253
-Thank you for coming, director.
-You must be the planner!

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:17.048
-Yes.
-You know, as an artist,

01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:19.801
I'm so honored by this opportunity
to serve my country!

01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:21.344
PYONGYANG SUNAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

01:01:21.427 --> 01:01:23.596
Wow, they are tossing someone
in the air!

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.933
Hooray for Park Sang-hyeon!

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:29.560
Hooray for the Republic of Korea!

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:31.854
Hooray for Park Sang-hyeon!

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.232
Hooray for the Republic of Korea!

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.866
-Gosh, my back.
-Look who it is!

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.536
The defeated troop is making an entrance.

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:53.501
-You pulled off a big one, Park.
-I did.

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:55.545
His Excellency will be pleased.

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:03.219
But is it really okay to pretend
this is North Korea?

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:08.474
Isn't saving lives more important
than ideology, brother?

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:11.686
Seo Go-myung.

01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:14.522
Man, what a name!

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:19.277
It's been so long since I've seen
such a reliable young man.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.362
I'm so proud and happy!

01:02:22.655 --> 01:02:27.535
So I heard that your father
fought in the Korean War.

01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:28.453
Yes, sir!

01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:35.793
He lost both legs
in the Reds' grenade attack, didn't he?

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.799
No, sir. It was our own grenade.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:48.181
Such is the tragedy of war.
Sacrifice always follows.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.767
-But he was always proud, sir!
-Is that right?

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.643
And he's about to get prouder now.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:56.397
His son's about to get decorated
with a medal and everything.

01:02:57.064 --> 01:02:59.400
-You may resume your duties.
-Yes, sir!

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:02.403
Minister.

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.699
Why don't we put him right in front?

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.367
It's the perfect picture!

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.497
Two generations of national heroes.

01:03:13.664 --> 01:03:18.669
All right, you have 30 seconds
to change and gather outside!

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.006
Wait, these ladies are too refined.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.176
This is how you keep it realistic.

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:26.469
You know how they say,

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:29.430
"Handsome men in the South,
beautiful ladies in the North."

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.140
-Can't remember.
-What?

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.726
Why are you wearing
the puppet army's uniform?

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:36.729
I used to be an actor!

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.857
If I can't capture this moment on film,

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:42.276
I want to at least be a part of it!

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.279
It's only realistic
if people believe it to be so.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.323
But will they believe you're a soldier?

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:52.870
Are you saying that

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.039
because I'm fat?

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:56.707
-Assistant Director.
-Yes, sir.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:59.460
Isn't this social discrimination
and prejudice?

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:02.630
Of course! In this day and age?
You can't say things like that.

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:06.425
I was just saying! Since you're a soldier…

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:09.929
Never mind. Go ahead.

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.765
You're right. Some soldier I am.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.226
Can't see his own dick
because of his pot belly.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:18.771
When did I ever say that?
I told you to go ahead!

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.314
This is my character, okay?

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:23.860
I'm a well-fed officer
from a wealthy family.

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:26.821
Even Kim Il Sung in the North is a pig!

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:28.114
-You know?
-Yes, I got it.

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.783
I've filmed eight anti-communist films!

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.369
-Eight! Your outdated--
-Okay! Go ahead!

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.806
Oh, fuck it.

01:04:56.642 --> 01:04:58.144
What does it matter?

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:01.522
Japanese Ride 351.

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.816
Your position,
80 miles west of the airport.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.236
Descend and maintain 4,000.
And maintain present heading.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:12.074
This is Japanese Ride 351.
Maintain 4,000 and approaching.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.118
Japanese Ride 351, roger.

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:16.370
Continue descent to 2,500.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:18.581
Cleared ILS runway 14 approach.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:20.499
Contact tower 129.1.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.463
Approaching runway 14.
Control tower, standby.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:33.679
Bravo!

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:40.645
Can I trust you to take care of things
until the hostages are off the plane?

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:42.688
Excuse me?

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.609
Sir, RAPCON is under US command,

01:05:46.692 --> 01:05:49.528
and landing is controlled
by our control tower.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:53.074
The landing controller is already
on standby. I don't know if I should--

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:55.451
What are you talking about?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.163
Until the hostages land on Kimpo soil,

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:03.000
Lieutenant Seo should be in control
and put an end to this

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:07.380
so that your heroic arc will be complete.

01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:12.843
When they get off,
we'll take a group photo here

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:15.221
and get some interviews as well.

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.681
And you get a medal.

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.517
What a great opportunity.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.668
The hero of Korea,
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung,

01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:49.922
is entering Seoul right now
with a million citizens welcoming him.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.718
You are a hero who saved
the lives of 106 Japanese passengers.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.261
How does that feel?

01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:59.598
I'm undeserving of the word "hero."

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.768
As a member of the ROK Air Force,

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.729
as an air traffic controller,

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:08.357
I simply did my duty.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.702
Oh, my stomach hurts.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:24.665
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung,
Korea's own hero!

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:27.626
Why are you taking a dump
after you wash your hands?

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.298
Mr. Park is asking for you.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.970
My beloved Mr. Park. We are ready to go.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.097
Okay. Great job.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.516
Now go greet our guests.

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:44.518
Me?

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.854
Since when do planners
show up on set?

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:51.233
Who else knows
North Korea better than you?

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:04.163
Fuck, that ridiculous rumor was true?

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.623
What rumor?

01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:08.542
You know you can't pull up
his resident registration number, right?

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:13.047
There are rumors
he was part of the North's puppet army.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:16.592
And you know how Mr. Park's father
was a general back then?

01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:19.929
Among the puppet soldiers
they captured during battle,

01:08:20.012 --> 01:08:23.432
there was one that stood out
among others. A genius.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.351
And that was Nobody?

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:28.521
Yes! They erased all his records

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.107
and kept him as a fixer
for two generations.

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:32.775
That's ridiculous.

01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:35.778
So you're saying we've been
hunting Reds with a Red?

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:39.698
Wouldn't Mr. Park just have
given him a new identity instead?

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.451
Then they can't keep him on a leash.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.621
Look.

01:08:45.704 --> 01:08:49.166
He drags him around everywhere
and makes him do all the dirty work.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:28.330
So you've decided to join us
and witness history in the making.

01:09:28.414 --> 01:09:30.916
I'm so thrilled
that I'm positively shaking.

01:09:31.458 --> 01:09:33.169
It'll go well, won't it?

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:37.339
We managed to slap something together.
Let's just hope it holds.

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:11.582
This morning,

01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:13.626
I didn't think I'd be coming to Pyongyang.

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:17.296
You will all be heading back
to Japan soon.

01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:21.008
Thank goodness
we didn't have to resort to Plan B.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.177
Plan B?

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.263
All right, the plane is coming in!

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:30.434
Welcome team, shake those pom-poms!
Come on, show me what you've got!

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:32.937
Cameras! Start rolling!

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.147
Puppet soldiers! In formation!

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.857
All right, ready!

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:41.528
Action!

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.000
Japanese Ride 351.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.418
Welcome to Pyongyang.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.087
You may open the door and get off.

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.685
Why aren't they coming out?

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:38.252
Shut up!

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.767
Comrades of the Revolution! Welcome!

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.352
We've prepared

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.604
a press conference at the airport--

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:03.277
Japanese Ride 351,
do you have any problem?

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.114
Is this really Pyongyang?

01:12:11.952 --> 01:12:13.954
Where else would this be?

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:18.751
A comrade saw a US plane
on the runway.

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:20.169
I clearly saw

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:23.422
"Northwest" on its tail.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:29.053
Why is there a capitalist plane
in the land of revolution?

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.900
It's a decoy aircraft.

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:48.322
We'll be sending soldiers
of the revolution like you to the US.

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:55.245
You're going to hit the US directly…?

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.876
North Korea's really something else.

01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:02.795
Yeah.

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:05.339
Leader.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.634
Take a look at this!

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.146
What?

01:13:22.022 --> 01:13:23.315
A Black person?

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.609
He's looking at us

01:13:25.692 --> 01:13:28.237
while eating a burger.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.617
That idiot.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:43.127
It's the Soviet army
stationed in Pyongyang.

01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:48.340
Are there Black people
in the Soviet Union?

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:51.885
I've never heard
of Black people living there.

01:13:52.636 --> 01:13:55.305
But I've also never heard
that there weren't any there.

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.475
I think there could be some there.

01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:00.227
It's a huge country, you know.

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:01.937
Do you think so?

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.857
Look outside.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.733
It's clearly Pyongyang.

01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:09.027
Hey.

01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:12.573
Let me give you a piece of advice.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:17.453
You shouldn't believe everything you see.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.582
I thought my parents loved each other!

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.795
Go find a passenger with a radio.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.843
Alexander Pushkin was Black too.

01:14:32.926 --> 01:14:33.886
Who's that?

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.929
The father of modern Russian literature.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.724
Come on, that's common knowledge
for a soviet follower.

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.020
Common knowledge…

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.579
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:04.249
I would like to ask you
a general knowledge question.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:06.960
As far as I know,

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:11.840
you are currently running
a five-year national economic plan.

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:14.968
Which year are you on now?

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.979
I think you may be mistaken.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:28.857
The five-year economic plan,

01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:31.902
which was once in flight
like a winged beast,

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:34.446
ended ten years ago.

01:15:38.575 --> 01:15:39.493
Then,

01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:44.081
when is the Supreme Leader's birthday?

01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:47.167
Our beloved comrade Kim Il Sung--

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:48.502
No!

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:50.003
Not you.

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:58.011
You there.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.307
You! The fat one.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:06.895
I'm talking to you, fatso!
Stop looking around!

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.730
Answer me!

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.024
When is the Supreme Leader's birthday?

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:13.860
I…

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.113
do not speak…

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:18.490
Japanese.

01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:23.829
This is…

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.081
This is Pyongyang?

01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:27.541
Yes or no?

01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:33.088
Yes.

01:16:33.171 --> 01:16:36.550
This is Pyongyang? Yes or no?

01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:39.845
Leader! I found a radio…

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.897
Yes or no?

01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:54.484
This is Pyongyang? Yes or no?

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.069
-"Yes or no?"
-Yes or no?

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:57.738
-Yes!
-Yes or no?

01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:00.991
-Yes!
-Yes or no?

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:07.122
Louis Armstrong.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.876
This is American capitalist music!

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:27.225
Yes or no?

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.604
What the heck is he saying?

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:33.106
Rock, paper, scissors?

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:37.069
Yes or no?

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:40.739
Yes or no?

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.661
No.

01:17:57.297 --> 01:17:58.924
CHAPTER 4
BAD NEWS

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:02.260
A Japanese aircraft, hijacked by Reds
and en route to North Korea,

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.513
made an emergency landing
at Kimpo Airport.

01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:07.307
It's tough as it is with the North.

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:12.604
And now we even have
Japanese Red b******* here?

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.981
Send them off already to their Red Land!

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:17.818
They're not holding Koreans as hostages.

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:22.823
I'm just scared that our soldiers
might get sacrificed.

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.118
I knew this would happen.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:29.162
You didn't have to stir the pot so much.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:32.499
The President was busy
with important business,

01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:34.459
but he's been briefed.

01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:38.880
He is deeply aware
of the gravity of the situation.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:42.217
And he emphasized
that not one life will be lost

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:45.512
on Korean soil, no matter what.

01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:47.556
Don't you understand what
His Excellency wants?

01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:49.224
They're not even our citizens.

01:18:49.307 --> 01:18:52.227
He clearly wants the plane
to take off and be gone to the North!

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.646
Oh, come on, brother!

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:59.359
Why are you making His Excellency
into a heartless, inhumane person?

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:03.780
He obviously wants to negotiate
and get them off the plane!

01:19:04.781 --> 01:19:06.825
I feel like we're losing.

01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:10.162
So who's right?

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:14.708
What he wants is for them
to figure it out without involving him.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:20.881
Then, let's decide what His Excellency's
intentions are democratically!

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.383
Majority rule.

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:28.054
By a show of hands? Is this okay?

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.809
Japan is sending
Minister of Transport Sugimoto

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:37.814
and Deputy Minister of Transport Ishida
to Korea to work closely on the situation.

01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:39.858
First time in Korea?

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:45.447
Just 25 years ago, everything was ours,
including this airport.

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:49.409
So all the officials here
speak Japanese as a given.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:50.786
You don't need an interpreter.

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:54.873
How did that plane end up here, I wonder?

01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:58.710
"It's not like the plan was successful."

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.130
"Will you take responsibility

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.049
if we end up with dead bodies?"

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:10.764
That's probably how
His Excellency feels right now.

01:20:10.847 --> 01:20:14.100
He's right. He'll have issues
with the process as well.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:15.977
The Japanese will be here soon.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:19.981
Imagine if they find out
that we disguised Korea as a Red state.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.734
Wouldn't he be embarrassed
to look upon our own flag?

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:49.511
Well, well. Our very own
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:54.766
What?

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:04.359
How could you turn a proud country
like ours into a Red state?

01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:11.324
I mean, earlier you told me to--

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.913
Making excuses

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:21.084
is a bad habit of those who fail.

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:22.711
You know?

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:29.634
Everyone.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:34.848
Can we just blame everything on the rock
because we tripped and fell on it?

01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:35.891
Can you?

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:40.395
Put your hands down already.
What are you, children?

01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:42.314
A show of hands?

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:45.483
Yes, majority rule is great.

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:50.864
But isn't a democratic country
about respecting the minority as well?

01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:53.950
His Excellency once said

01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:58.663
that the US is the big brother,
and Korea and Japan are siblings.

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:04.753
But those bastards keep treating us
like the youngest. Isn't that right?

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:11.259
But what if we take matters
into our own hands and resolve this?

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:13.845
Then they'll be bowing to us and saying,

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.389
"Arigato, arigato."

01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:21.436
That's how we'll become the world's
second big brother.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.396
Use your heads!

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:24.940
You're right!

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:26.650
-You're right!
-Absolutely right.

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:32.822
Doesn't it make your heart
just swell with pride?

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:37.035
We must never, ever forget our history!

01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:40.580
Just thinking about it

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:43.917
makes my blood boil and my teeth clench!

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.627
Think of the Imjin War!

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:48.838
Think of when those bastards invaded
during the colonial rule--

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:52.008
And I'm sure they had
their own grievances.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.552
-Oh my, Mr. Kim.
-Minister.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.554
-It's been too long.
-Indeed.

01:22:57.847 --> 01:22:59.474
Please have a seat, Minister.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:04.062
Our government never got word
about our civilian plane landing here.

01:23:04.562 --> 01:23:06.690
Was this an official operation
by the Korean government?

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:11.111
If it were official,
wouldn't we have let you know?

01:23:11.194 --> 01:23:13.196
What? If it's not official…

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:15.949
Regrettably, it seems…

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:20.370
that someone here acted on their own

01:23:20.453 --> 01:23:23.748
and lied to them,
claiming that this was Pyongyang.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.041
Acted on their own?

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:27.419
Who was it?

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:41.683
I was the one…

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:44.602
who did it.

01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:50.525
Thank you.

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.238
It was truly a brave
and remarkable operation.

01:23:56.656 --> 01:23:57.866
Lieutenant Go-myung?

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:08.334
Right.

01:24:08.835 --> 01:24:14.215
I was simply following the orders
from Director Park over there.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.509
I see.

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:20.221
On behalf of the Japanese government,
we offer our deepest gratitude.

01:24:23.349 --> 01:24:27.562
There is no need for such words
between brothers!

01:24:28.813 --> 01:24:30.732
Lieutenant Seo. You're the best.

01:24:30.815 --> 01:24:32.525
What's the current situation like?

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:39.449
Since the plane lost power,
they should be reaching out soon.

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:42.827
Plan B?

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:49.250
Did you say you were a doctor?

01:24:51.961 --> 01:24:54.339
What do you think they are planning?

01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:55.965
I don't know.

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.597
Hey, listen.

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:06.810
Why don't you ask them to start the engine
in exchange for some hostages--

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:12.732
I want to talk to the person
who landed us here.

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:14.901
Yes, I'm listening.

01:25:15.902 --> 01:25:17.195
Your voice is different.

01:25:18.321 --> 01:25:20.907
I am in charge here.

01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:25.203
Then are you the one who deceived us?

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:28.373
It was a plan to save innocent lives.

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:30.250
First off,

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:35.421
release the passengers,
and then we can discuss conditions--

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:37.090
Let's meet in person and talk.

01:25:37.173 --> 01:25:39.926
If you're the one who landed us here,

01:25:40.009 --> 01:25:42.262
then you should be here in person.

01:25:43.054 --> 01:25:44.597
Inside the plane?

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:46.683
Come alone and unarmed.

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.102
If you don't come within 30 minutes,

01:25:49.602 --> 01:25:52.856
we'll behead a hostage every ten minutes
and throw the heads out.

01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:54.941
Over.

01:25:56.734 --> 01:25:58.403
Will you really be all right alone?

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:02.824
Unfortunately,

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:08.955
they want to speak with the person

01:26:09.038 --> 01:26:11.291
who landed them here.

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.963
These guys are really perceptive.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:21.593
I never expected them
to remember his voice.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:25.430
An order should come
from the Blue House tomorrow.

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.140
Until then, you need to buy more time.

01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:30.351
Why the fuck do I have to get beat up
and do all the dirty work?

01:26:30.935 --> 01:26:35.231
My job was to land the plane safely
in Kimpo. I succeeded in my mission!

01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:38.818
Okay, I'm the one who failed. Better?

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:40.987
Don't touch me.

01:26:41.654 --> 01:26:43.323
Failure is contagious.

01:26:45.116 --> 01:26:49.412
Ouch. That wasn't necessary!

01:26:49.495 --> 01:26:50.872
You hurt my feelings.

01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:55.335
Careful! The paint's still new there,
so it's slippery!

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:23.863
Come in.

01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:41.172
So you're the boy who cried Pyongyang.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:45.885
Could you please put the light down?

01:27:46.386 --> 01:27:49.514
The engine shut down
because you landed us here.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:53.309
They're connecting it now,
so the power should be on soon.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:58.564
I knew they'd send someone like you.

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:02.610
It's typical of rank-obsessed bureaucrats.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:06.114
You knew someone like me
would have no power.

01:28:08.491 --> 01:28:10.535
So why did you call me here?

01:28:17.917 --> 01:28:19.294
I wanted to…

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:22.755
show you their faces in person.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.718
Look carefully, boy who cried Pyongyang.

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:32.932
These are the people who will die
because of your lies.

01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:35.768
If you don't want to become a murderer,

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:39.147
send everyone on this plane
to Pyongyang right now.

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:44.193
The weather is bad right now,
and it's too dark--

01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:45.445
You fool!

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:48.781
You already deceived us once!

01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:51.534
Then ask the pilot!

01:28:52.535 --> 01:28:53.619
Moreover,

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:56.789
if you cross
the Military Demarcation Line now,

01:28:57.498 --> 01:29:01.919
what will you do about the North Korean
anti-aircraft guns all over the DMZ?

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.213
If you get shot down,

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:07.216
none of your bodies will be recovered.

01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:23.649
We did all we can. It's time to step back

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.110
and do what Mr. Kim said.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.820
Send them off to North Korea.

01:29:34.118 --> 01:29:35.870
Here's the thing.

01:29:37.622 --> 01:29:42.502
I never reverse even when I drive. Why?

01:29:43.252 --> 01:29:46.631
Because it makes me feel like
I took the wrong road the whole time,

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.674
and it pisses me off!

01:29:49.258 --> 01:29:52.470
If I say I'm going this way,
that's the right way.

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:55.848
And it should continue
to be the right way.

01:29:57.558 --> 01:30:02.271
And that's what your job is, brother.

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:06.025
I was just worried
that if a bomb really goes off,

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:10.405
you might have to take the blame for it.

01:30:12.156 --> 01:30:15.910
One word from me,
and he'll press the button.

01:30:16.452 --> 01:30:18.538
But you won't.

01:30:20.623 --> 01:30:22.959
Because there's nothing
you can gain from that.

01:30:24.877 --> 01:30:26.921
This is our Plan B.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.340
We'll burn away to white ash

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:32.635
and show the whole world
our revolutionary will.

01:30:34.637 --> 01:30:36.013
That way,

01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:38.057
there will be a second

01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:41.060
and a third Ashita no Joe
following in our footsteps.

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:43.104
Ashita no Joe?

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:49.235
From the manga series?

01:30:51.362 --> 01:30:53.197
You know Ashita no Joe?

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:56.993
Of course I do.

01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:59.370
It's a masterpiece.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:00.746
It truly is.

01:31:01.372 --> 01:31:02.665
Especially the ending.

01:31:02.748 --> 01:31:04.500
-Yes, yes, exactly!
-Right?

01:31:05.751 --> 01:31:08.421
At the end,

01:31:08.504 --> 01:31:10.590
I don't think Joe died.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.050
-What?
-No.

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:15.928
He died.

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:40.995
Do you think
giving up one's own life is easy?

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:44.207
They will never be able to detonate it.

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:49.670
But let's be real. It's not my fault
even if it does explode.

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:53.174
I'm the one desperately praying
that it doesn't explode!

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:57.136
My life…

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:00.723
is your deadline.

01:32:03.559 --> 01:32:05.853
If we don't get to Pyongyang,

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:09.065
I'll die anyway.

01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:12.985
How is he?

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:17.365
You avoided his vital organs,
just as I taught you.

01:32:18.115 --> 01:32:22.411
If we can stop the bleeding,
he could last another day.

01:32:23.913 --> 01:32:25.623
Did you hear that, Leader?

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.583
I nailed it!

01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:34.173
These lunatics…

01:32:36.467 --> 01:32:38.302
You have until noon tomorrow.

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:41.931
If you go over by even one second,

01:32:42.848 --> 01:32:44.976
the plane will blow up.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.771
The same conditions apply
if Leader dies first.

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:51.023
Please.

01:32:51.107 --> 01:32:53.568
Please just send us to Pyongyang.

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:55.194
At least that way,

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:57.738
we can all still live!

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.911
You capitalists

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:09.959
only see the price tags
and not the true worth of people.

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:13.963
I'm curious now.

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:21.429
What price will you put
on the passengers' lives?

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.517
I told you it's slippery there, mister!

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:28.978
Oh, fuck it all!

01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:33.107
Then you should've sprinkled
some dirt on it, you son of a bitch!

01:33:39.196 --> 01:33:41.324
Good work, Lieutenant Seo.

01:33:41.407 --> 01:33:44.452
We've got plenty of time
until noon tomorrow.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:49.081
They said they refuse
to negotiate before then.

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:51.459
-Furthermore--
-What did I say?

01:33:51.542 --> 01:33:54.045
-We need to send them off now!
-Oh, please.

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:57.798
North Korea put out a statement saying
they'll welcome them. So send them off!

01:33:57.882 --> 01:33:58.966
Is this fatty tuna?

01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:03.763
Did North Korea release a statement?

01:34:03.846 --> 01:34:06.474
That's medium-fatty tuna.
This is super-fatty tuna.

01:34:06.557 --> 01:34:08.225
-Oh, this one?
-It's good.

01:34:08.851 --> 01:34:11.270
What was it like inside the plane?

01:34:14.273 --> 01:34:16.442
What were the hijackers like?

01:34:18.527 --> 01:34:21.155
Did they really seem dangerous enough
to carry out a suicide bombing?

01:34:41.634 --> 01:34:42.551
No.

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:47.014
They were just reckless kids.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.265
Hey!

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:51.143
Are you going to take responsibility
if things go wrong?

01:34:51.227 --> 01:34:54.647
Come on, he saw it with his own eyes.

01:34:55.439 --> 01:34:58.025
If we promise them
in His Excellency's name

01:34:58.109 --> 01:35:00.361
that we will send them to the North

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:03.906
once they release all the passengers,

01:35:03.989 --> 01:35:05.908
this will be solved in no time.

01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:08.494
Then why don't we contact
the President right now?

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:12.331
Right now…

01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:16.043
he should be in bed.

01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:18.379
-Excuse me?
-But…

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:20.965
he rises early in the morning!

01:35:21.757 --> 01:35:23.008
Excuse me?

01:35:23.092 --> 01:35:25.302
-You're saying we just wait?
-That is a healthy habit.

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:26.762
-Here?
-Let's have a smoke.

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:28.347
-But…
-It's okay.

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.934
If things go south,

01:35:32.017 --> 01:35:35.312
we'll blame those idiot Josenjings.

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:38.816
-Don't go kicking the hornet's nest.
-But if everything goes well,

01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:42.403
Korea will have
resolved everything we failed to do.

01:35:44.947 --> 01:35:47.658
They'll probably demand
some big favor from us.

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:56.542
I told you. If you don't see me,
it means I'm working.

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:02.923
Wait. There's actually
a Korean passenger onboard?

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:03.883
Really?

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:05.593
That's news to me.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:09.305
It's an assumption based on the name.
Just an assumption.

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:11.515
I marked it right here.

01:36:12.224 --> 01:36:13.934
Yuuno Baku?

01:36:14.018 --> 01:36:15.644
That's a Japanese name!

01:36:15.728 --> 01:36:18.731
But it's in English,
so the surname comes second.

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:23.277
Baku Yuuno. Baku Yuno.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.570
Park Yun-ho.

01:36:27.823 --> 01:36:30.826
Don't be ridiculous!
You're talking nonsense.

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.036
Give it here!

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.622
Good heavens. Leave!

01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:36.499
What kind of nonsense is this?

01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:37.875
Is the news a joke to you?

01:36:38.417 --> 01:36:42.421
How dare you make light
of the news in this day and age!

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:44.715
I'm a member of the press, all right?

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:46.884
-Director!
-What? What now?

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:50.054
You know what I'm best at, right?

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:52.932
-Rooting out Reds.
-No.

01:36:54.517 --> 01:36:58.521
Making Reds out of normal people.

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:05.361
There's no need
to get all scary like that.

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:10.991
I know full well
that the press shouldn't lie.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.580
So I'm telling you,
it's just an assumption.

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:22.086
Today, the name Park Yun-ho, allegedly
a Korean-Japanese man, has been found

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:26.173
on the list of passengers aboard
the Japanese airplane in Kimpo Airport.

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:31.011
Oh, and tack on this little headline
from three months ago.

01:37:33.722 --> 01:37:36.684
This incident is reminiscent
of a similar hijacking of the YS-11

01:37:36.767 --> 01:37:41.063
that occurred just three months ago
by the North Korean puppet army.

01:37:41.146 --> 01:37:44.483
They locked us up one by one

01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:46.527
and then subjected us
to brutal electrical torture.

01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:47.862
What do you think?

01:37:48.654 --> 01:37:50.865
Is it tugging at your heartstrings?

01:37:53.325 --> 01:37:54.451
So, that…

01:37:55.494 --> 01:37:57.454
Korean passenger story is a lie?

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.873
What does it matter?

01:38:00.791 --> 01:38:04.086
Oh, the moon is beautiful tonight.

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:08.716
Maybe the far side of the moon
isn't as beautiful.

01:38:08.799 --> 01:38:12.011
Did you know we'll never see
the far side of the moon?

01:38:12.094 --> 01:38:14.972
Because its orbit matches its rotation.

01:38:15.055 --> 01:38:18.350
It was a philosophical question,
not a scientific one.

01:38:19.101 --> 01:38:20.936
"Sometimes the truth
lies on the far side of the moon.

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.022
But that doesn't mean
what's on the near side is fiction."

01:38:23.105 --> 01:38:24.148
By Truman Shady.

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.902
-Haven't you heard that one?
-Of course I have!

01:38:27.985 --> 01:38:31.280
There could be all kinds of bullshit
happening in the dark,

01:38:31.363 --> 01:38:33.115
but people only believe what they see.

01:38:33.198 --> 01:38:36.160
And that becomes the truth,
like the news.

01:38:36.243 --> 01:38:37.620
Maybe it's the moon making you talk crap.

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:39.705
No matter which side you look at,
it's still the moon.

01:38:39.788 --> 01:38:42.207
You're the one barking nonsense, not me!

01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:45.169
Are you calling me a dog?

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:46.921
She's here.

01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:50.424
Thank you for coming at such a late hour.

01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:54.553
Oh, you're even more beautiful in person.

01:38:54.637 --> 01:38:57.640
What would you like me to do?

01:38:57.723 --> 01:39:00.935
Just tell the truth, that's all.

01:39:01.018 --> 01:39:02.937
-The others?
-They're on their way.

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:06.357
We absolutely need the electrocuted guy.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.817
We are still trying to save people,
aren't we?

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:13.322
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

01:39:13.405 --> 01:39:14.782
This way, please.

01:39:19.244 --> 01:39:21.830
Everything will be solved
as soon as the President gives the word.

01:39:22.915 --> 01:39:24.249
And if he doesn't?

01:39:25.668 --> 01:39:27.294
What happens then?

01:39:30.172 --> 01:39:32.341
Like you said,
they're a bunch of reckless kids.

01:39:34.677 --> 01:39:37.179
Didn't you say that
so they wouldn't send them off?

01:39:53.195 --> 01:39:55.239
KIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

01:40:00.077 --> 01:40:03.247
The 66 days I spent in North Korea

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:06.083
made me feel less than human.

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.460
Sometimes, even the truth lies.

01:40:08.544 --> 01:40:09.628
I felt like…

01:40:11.213 --> 01:40:13.674
I would be better off dead.

01:40:13.757 --> 01:40:16.135
And lies also tell the truth.

01:40:16.218 --> 01:40:19.096
Our station spoke
with the Korean Embassy in Japan

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:21.181
and was able to confirm

01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:24.977
13 people named Park Yun-ho
who currently reside in Japan.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.187
I was tortured and electrocuted

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:29.982
by the puppet army.

01:40:30.899 --> 01:40:35.070
I am currently being treated
at a psychiatric hospital.

01:40:35.612 --> 01:40:39.283
It's most likely that Mr. Park Yun-ho

01:40:40.409 --> 01:40:43.454
will suffer the same fate as me.

01:40:48.625 --> 01:40:52.337
Real events that happened,
a little bit of creativity,

01:40:52.838 --> 01:40:54.882
and the willingness to suspend disbelief.

01:40:54.965 --> 01:40:56.884
If these three components come together…

01:40:56.967 --> 01:40:59.970
Those damn puppet bastards from the North!

01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.599
-Yes!
-Take them down!

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:14.943
An anti-Communist demonstration
occurred in front of Kimpo Airport.

01:41:15.027 --> 01:41:17.571
The people are crying out
for peace and liberty.

01:41:17.654 --> 01:41:22.326
And they are demanding the release
of Mr. Park Yun-ho and other passengers.

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:25.204
What a sight to behold.

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:31.210
Koreans are so full of love,
emotion, and energy!

01:41:32.294 --> 01:41:36.090
The Blue House is en route.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:40.302
I'm sure he's worried
about the election next year.

01:41:41.011 --> 01:41:42.221
Wouldn't you say

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:46.642
that this is the greatness of democracy?

01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:49.103
I wonder if he'll come in person.

01:41:50.521 --> 01:41:51.396
No.

01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:55.609
His Excellency could not make it,
for some unknown reason,

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:59.321
but the First Lady will be coming instead.

01:42:10.749 --> 01:42:12.960
Could you take the photos
from the left instead?

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:17.631
That's my better side.

01:42:29.101 --> 01:42:33.313
His Excellency is unwell.

01:42:34.439 --> 01:42:36.066
How so? Where is he feeling ill?

01:42:36.859 --> 01:42:38.777
Don't worry yourselves too much.

01:42:39.361 --> 01:42:42.823
How could you say that?

01:42:42.906 --> 01:42:47.286
Depending on the condition,
it could be a national disaster.

01:42:48.787 --> 01:42:49.913
He is…

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:51.874
very hungover right now.

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:58.130
He had a few too many drinks.

01:42:58.213 --> 01:43:00.257
Send someone immediately

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.676
and get some natural hangover remedy
from Taebaek Mountain.

01:43:02.759 --> 01:43:04.094
His Excellency…

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:12.269
is more concerned about this crisis
than his hangover.

01:43:14.354 --> 01:43:18.901
He holds his liquor far better
than most adult men, as you know.

01:43:46.011 --> 01:43:48.180
You must be the controller.

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:53.143
The Republic of Korea
will never forget your service.

01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:56.396
Thank you, ma'am.

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:01.068
Those poor people.

01:44:03.987 --> 01:44:08.825
I can't imagine the fear
that is gripping them inside that plane.

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:14.248
But I heard that there were…

01:44:15.707 --> 01:44:18.085
some people here
who wanted to send them north.

01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:24.591
His Excellency was adamant
on having no casualties on our--

01:44:24.675 --> 01:44:26.009
Up in the North!

01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:30.013
Do you even know
the horrors occurring there now?

01:44:32.641 --> 01:44:34.643
She pointed to the east, not the north,

01:44:35.477 --> 01:44:37.521
but no one said a thing.

01:44:39.898 --> 01:44:44.403
If you agreed to send them
to North Korea, please leave this room.

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:47.489
You don't deserve to be here.

01:44:49.366 --> 01:44:51.118
Ma'am, what we meant was--

01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:52.577
I said now!

01:44:54.538 --> 01:44:56.498
That fucking crazy bitch!

01:44:57.165 --> 01:45:00.210
You know what? Let it fucking blow up!

01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:02.587
Let it blow up!

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.007
Madam.

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:09.761
North Korea has already guaranteed
the safety of our citizens.

01:45:10.929 --> 01:45:13.598
Deputy Minister.
Do you really believe what communists say?

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:17.227
What about the rest of you?

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:18.770
-No, ma'am!
-No, ma'am!

01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:22.983
Twenty years ago…

01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:29.948
It was a peaceful Sunday morning
on June 25, 1950.

01:45:31.283 --> 01:45:33.827
That communist puppet army
stormed in from the North.

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:38.999
They covered this land in blood
and took countless lives.

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:41.752
I will never forget what happened.

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:44.004
We cannot and will not

01:45:45.047 --> 01:45:48.050
believe those evil communists ever again.

01:45:54.056 --> 01:45:55.599
Our anti-communist hero,

01:45:57.142 --> 01:45:58.810
Lee Seung-bok, was just a little boy,

01:45:59.936 --> 01:46:04.733
but his last words before he was killed
by the North Korean spies were…

01:46:04.816 --> 01:46:08.111
-"I hate communism!"
-"I hate communism!"

01:46:12.449 --> 01:46:15.410
I hereby give this order in the name
of the President of the Republic of Korea.

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:20.665
The second they release the passengers,
tell them to get lost and go north.

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:29.800
That's all.

01:46:32.386 --> 01:46:33.845
Hooray!

01:46:34.763 --> 01:46:36.681
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

01:46:54.366 --> 01:46:57.786
-Finally, the wheels…
-Began turning again.

01:46:58.829 --> 01:47:00.539
Good news!

01:47:00.622 --> 01:47:02.165
The document you just received

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:05.043
ensures you'll be able to
enter North Korea,

01:47:05.127 --> 01:47:07.546
as long as you let everyone go.

01:47:07.629 --> 01:47:10.882
It's confirmed
by the government of Republic of Korea!

01:47:10.966 --> 01:47:12.843
You fool! Are you joking?

01:47:14.803 --> 01:47:17.097
You want us to believe
this piece of paper?

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:20.016
Your army will charge onto the plane
as soon as we let the hostages go!

01:47:21.184 --> 01:47:22.561
It's for real this time.

01:47:23.395 --> 01:47:25.689
Just let the passengers go,

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:27.441
and you can go wherever you want!

01:47:27.983 --> 01:47:30.652
There was one thing we overlooked.

01:47:31.695 --> 01:47:34.739
No one believed
the boy who cried wolf anymore.

01:47:34.823 --> 01:47:38.493
We will only release them
after we set foot in North Korea.

01:47:38.577 --> 01:47:41.371
If you don't let us go, the plane
will blow exactly at noon. Over.

01:47:49.087 --> 01:47:50.714
Fuck.

01:47:52.549 --> 01:47:53.925
No, Leader!

01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:57.637
If you die before noon, I'll kill you!

01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:59.181
I lied.

01:48:00.015 --> 01:48:03.393
Those bastards are all insane.

01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:06.730
If that bomb goes off…

01:48:08.565 --> 01:48:11.067
their deaths are all on me.

01:48:11.693 --> 01:48:14.446
I feel like you're thinking
too highly of yourself.

01:48:15.447 --> 01:48:17.824
All we did was follow orders.

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:22.829
Does justifying it like that
help you sleep at night?

01:48:27.459 --> 01:48:30.170
Justification is a survival instinct.

01:48:32.047 --> 01:48:34.549
Without it, it'd be a tough life to live.

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:36.927
Considering the situation,

01:48:37.719 --> 01:48:39.679
isn't it time for us to try something?

01:48:39.763 --> 01:48:40.889
Just now,

01:48:41.723 --> 01:48:43.558
I was praying.

01:48:43.642 --> 01:48:44.768
Praying?

01:48:46.561 --> 01:48:47.604
Let's have a meeting.

01:48:48.230 --> 01:48:49.314
Let's have a meeting!

01:48:49.397 --> 01:48:50.815
What meeting?

01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:56.321
We cannot refute
the will of His Excellency!

01:48:56.404 --> 01:48:58.406
So all you're doing is praying?

01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:59.783
Praying?

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:01.451
Does prayer solve the current problem?

01:49:01.535 --> 01:49:05.747
Will it improve the situation?
Will it please His Excellency?

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:09.251
What are you going to do?

01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:12.128
I should at least tell them
to send them north.

01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:14.756
Pull yourself together.
You're just a controller.

01:49:17.509 --> 01:49:19.594
At least I'm not a nobody.

01:49:23.848 --> 01:49:26.393
If I can't say what's on my mind,
how is this not a dictatorship?

01:49:27.477 --> 01:49:29.187
A dictatorship?

01:49:29.271 --> 01:49:31.439
A dictatorship?

01:49:31.523 --> 01:49:35.360
At least we don't crown
and revere kings like you.

01:49:35.443 --> 01:49:36.987
Don't interpret this.

01:49:38.363 --> 01:49:41.908
Mr. Park! You do realize
you committed a diplomatic offense, yes?

01:49:42.534 --> 01:49:43.994
What was that?

01:49:44.661 --> 01:49:46.288
Did you just hit me?

01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:48.248
Wow. Did you see that?

01:49:48.331 --> 01:49:50.041
You saw it, right?

01:49:50.542 --> 01:49:53.461
He's just casually throwing hands now.

01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:00.093
Didn't anyone see that?

01:50:00.176 --> 01:50:02.012
Seriously? No one saw it?

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.388
I did!

01:50:03.471 --> 01:50:05.974
I saw it with my own two eyes.

01:50:06.057 --> 01:50:07.267
-You did?
-Yes!

01:50:08.226 --> 01:50:12.981
This is no longer about feelings offended.
This is a military provocation!

01:50:13.064 --> 01:50:15.108
And from now on, everything's in Korean.

01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:17.027
This is the Republic of Korea!

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:19.195
-Mr. Park!
-Lieutenant Seo.

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:22.282
You get it, don't you?
This is a game of chicken.

01:50:22.365 --> 01:50:25.452
They'll never be able to detonate it,
so don't call them.

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:30.248
Answer.

01:50:31.583 --> 01:50:34.669
Hey, you little punk. Answer me!

01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:48.475
Praying?

01:50:48.558 --> 01:50:50.185
Praying doesn't change anything!

01:50:50.268 --> 01:50:52.145
Stupid idiots!

01:50:52.228 --> 01:50:55.315
Idiots! You stupid idiots!
Use your heads, you fools!

01:50:55.398 --> 01:50:58.026
Are you all lacking brain cells?
Do you not have a brain at all?

01:50:58.693 --> 01:51:03.114
Whether the bomb blows up or not,
the result's already been decided.

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.076
So you should get out of here first.

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:10.288
Do you really think they'll blow it up?

01:51:10.372 --> 01:51:11.247
No, right?

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:12.791
Of course not.

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:17.045
But if anything does happen,

01:51:18.296 --> 01:51:20.465
everything falls on the field commander.

01:51:21.424 --> 01:51:25.553
That's right! The field commander.
How dare this shameless--

01:51:26.054 --> 01:51:27.347
Wait a second.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:29.974
That's me, isn't it?

01:51:31.685 --> 01:51:33.103
Of course not.

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:36.606
You're the one who assigns
the field commander.

01:51:37.315 --> 01:51:41.194
There are so many other pressing issues,
but we've neglected them for so long!

01:51:41.736 --> 01:51:44.114
Return to your posts and do your duty!

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:47.325
-Serve the country with all your heart!
-Let's go!

01:51:48.243 --> 01:51:49.911
Those brainless idiots!

01:51:53.873 --> 01:51:56.209
What is the point in praying?

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:29.451
Religion…

01:52:31.035 --> 01:52:34.164
It's a business that can never fail,
don't you think?

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:37.709
Desperate people end up
turning to God--

01:52:37.792 --> 01:52:40.211
You have no right to mock me!

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.756
You don't even have a plan!

01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:48.219
Was it any different

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:50.472
in your country, sir?

01:52:54.392 --> 01:52:56.311
I'm so mad.

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:05.111
There's nothing I can do…

01:53:06.988 --> 01:53:09.407
except stand here and watch.

01:53:10.742 --> 01:53:12.994
This feeling of helplessness…

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.711
Do you have anything to say
to the victims of this incident?

01:54:03.795 --> 01:54:06.589
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung,
say something.

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:11.177
Defendant Seo Go-myung
aided in the deaths of 106 innocent lives

01:54:11.261 --> 01:54:14.055
and is hereby sentenced to death.

01:54:22.564 --> 01:54:25.316
Why the hell are you breaking stuff?

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:28.611
-You're not going to talk to them?
-Did you not…

01:54:29.612 --> 01:54:31.322
Did you not hear what Director Park said?

01:54:31.406 --> 01:54:32.448
He said not to initiate!

01:54:34.576 --> 01:54:36.160
Director Park isn't here right now.

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:38.705
How so?

01:54:38.788 --> 01:54:41.165
That fucking motherfucker!

01:54:41.249 --> 01:54:44.460
What am I supposed to do here?
He dumped all of this on me now?

01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:46.754
What the hell am I supposed to do?

01:54:48.047 --> 01:54:50.258
He suddenly named me field commander!

01:54:51.426 --> 01:54:54.888
It's you, isn't it? You bastard!
You dumped this shit show on me!

01:54:54.971 --> 01:54:56.014
Minister!

01:54:56.097 --> 01:54:58.808
It certainly is a shit show.

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:02.437
But the question is,
who made this shit show?

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.898
Why does the field commander
always have to take the blame?

01:55:04.981 --> 01:55:09.444
The one who ignored orders
and caused this shit show

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:11.946
is right over there.

01:55:15.033 --> 01:55:17.327
-What are you doing?
-You bastard!

01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:19.329
How are you going to fix this?

01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:31.758
Japanese Ride 351.

01:55:31.841 --> 01:55:33.426
Japanese Ride 351.

01:55:33.509 --> 01:55:35.386
This is Kimpo Control Tower.

01:55:38.056 --> 01:55:39.807
The military is withdrawing.

01:55:40.683 --> 01:55:42.352
Is this your answer?

01:55:43.061 --> 01:55:44.896
I will not lie to you anymore.

01:55:44.979 --> 01:55:47.982
The condition still stands.

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:52.070
As I told you earlier,
if you let the hostages go,

01:55:52.153 --> 01:55:53.571
everyone can live.

01:55:53.655 --> 01:55:56.324
Don't try to stall for time.

01:55:59.535 --> 01:56:01.204
Even Leader…

01:56:03.039 --> 01:56:04.707
doesn't have much time left.

01:56:04.791 --> 01:56:07.335
Are you going to give up this easily?

01:56:08.211 --> 01:56:11.172
Ashita no Joe fought until the end.

01:56:27.146 --> 01:56:29.941
You're right, boy who cried Pyongyang.

01:56:31.526 --> 01:56:33.194
Ashita no Joe

01:56:34.237 --> 01:56:37.156
burned brightly
until there were only ashes.

01:56:38.741 --> 01:56:43.037
After that death, there was nothing left.

01:56:43.621 --> 01:56:46.040
Nothing half-burned left behind.

01:56:47.208 --> 01:56:49.544
Just pure white ash.

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:53.506
Even though he didn't win in the end,

01:56:55.758 --> 01:56:58.511
that alone made it worthwhile
and meaningful.

01:56:59.470 --> 01:57:01.764
Ashita no Joe didn't die!

01:57:02.432 --> 01:57:05.143
The illustrator didn't color it in!

01:57:05.226 --> 01:57:07.854
So it just looks like he turned white
and faded into death!

01:57:07.937 --> 01:57:10.648
Please. Please!

01:57:10.732 --> 01:57:12.275
Let's meet and talk.

01:57:12.817 --> 01:57:14.527
I'll come back in!

01:57:15.778 --> 01:57:17.155
Oh, fuck!

01:57:21.492 --> 01:57:25.580
We've done all we can now.

01:57:32.128 --> 01:57:33.296
In the end,

01:57:34.088 --> 01:57:36.174
there are things
that can only end with sacrifice.

01:57:36.257 --> 01:57:38.718
FOUR MINUTES BEFORE DETONATION

01:57:39.761 --> 01:57:41.637
I don't know
whether I wanted to save them

01:57:42.305 --> 01:57:47.226
or I just didn't want to kill them.

01:57:48.436 --> 01:57:52.815
I was dragged here out of the blue,
made some absurd plan…

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:54.400
May I say this is North Korea?

01:57:56.694 --> 01:57:58.696
I hijacked the airwaves

01:57:59.405 --> 01:58:01.574
and turned Kimpo into Pyongyang.

01:58:04.952 --> 01:58:06.829
I may never become a hero,

01:58:07.872 --> 01:58:09.707
but I did not want to become a murderer.

01:58:13.961 --> 01:58:16.047
No. Please, no!

01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:17.048
No!

01:58:44.826 --> 01:58:46.577
FOUR MINUTES AGO

01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:47.829
In the end,

01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:51.207
there are things
that can only end with sacrifice.

01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:53.417
Sacrifice?

01:58:54.877 --> 01:58:56.129
In other words,

01:58:56.754 --> 01:58:58.714
you'd call it "responsibility."

01:59:00.133 --> 01:59:03.553
Just like the boy who ran out just now.

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:05.304
He didn't pray.

01:59:07.348 --> 01:59:08.558
He took action.

01:59:21.779 --> 01:59:23.114
Can you hear me?

01:59:24.407 --> 01:59:27.201
I am Shinichi Ishida,
the Deputy Minister of Transport.

01:59:27.952 --> 01:59:29.704
I request a hostage exchange.

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:33.249
I will go to Pyongyang with you.

01:59:34.458 --> 01:59:38.588
As Japan's Deputy Minister of Transport,
I can be your ticket to Pyongyang.

01:59:40.464 --> 01:59:41.507
No.

01:59:41.591 --> 01:59:42.842
Please, no!

01:59:42.925 --> 01:59:44.051
No!

01:59:45.887 --> 01:59:47.346
That must hurt.

01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:50.933
You've worked hard,

01:59:51.517 --> 01:59:53.227
boy who cried Pyongyang.

01:59:56.272 --> 02:00:00.151
The communists, who swore
to tear down classism and capitalism,

02:00:00.651 --> 02:00:04.739
ended up setting the price
for more than 100 civilians

02:00:04.822 --> 02:00:06.824
as that of one Japanese Deputy Minister.

02:00:24.842 --> 02:00:28.971
After much effort from our government,
over 50 Japanese hostages were freed

02:00:29.055 --> 02:00:31.307
from the violent,
reckless Red Army Faction

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:34.810
and emerged in more or less good health.

02:00:39.607 --> 02:00:41.692
Think of it as a little trip.

02:00:41.776 --> 02:00:43.277
To North Korea?

02:00:44.904 --> 02:00:46.572
How is this a little trip?

02:00:51.118 --> 02:00:52.536
However, in exchange,

02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:58.292
Deputy Minister Ishida was taken hostage
by the North Korean puppet army.

02:00:58.834 --> 02:01:01.254
Once Deputy Minister Shinichi
boarded the plane,

02:01:01.337 --> 02:01:06.092
the rest of the passengers
were able to return to their families.

02:01:41.252 --> 02:01:43.796
Your Excellency! How's your hangover?

02:01:43.879 --> 02:01:47.967
CHAPTER 5
GOOD NEWS

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:51.929
We hijacked their transmission.

02:01:54.265 --> 02:01:57.893
As they hijacked a physical plane,

02:01:57.977 --> 02:02:01.814
we hijacked the invisible airwaves.

02:02:03.024 --> 02:02:06.986
When you say "we,"
who else do you mean, Lieutenant?

02:02:14.076 --> 02:02:16.037
For every big job like this…

02:02:18.122 --> 02:02:21.709
there are always people who put in
their work namelessly and tirelessly.

02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:24.712
I'll leave it at that.

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:30.843
So the aircraft
didn't land here by mistake

02:02:30.926 --> 02:02:34.013
but due to deliberate efforts
from our government.

02:02:34.096 --> 02:02:36.766
Will it not cause North Korea
to provoke us somehow?

02:02:39.643 --> 02:02:40.895
The Republic of Korea

02:02:41.937 --> 02:02:44.065
continues its strong alliance with the US

02:02:44.774 --> 02:02:47.985
and will not bow down to any threat.

02:02:49.612 --> 02:02:54.200
You are a hero who saved 106 lives.
What's next in store for you?

02:02:54.825 --> 02:02:57.370
I'll have to finish
today's shift, first of all.

02:02:58.329 --> 02:02:59.914
Then I'll head back to base

02:03:00.498 --> 02:03:03.167
and catch myself on the nine o'clock news.

02:03:16.222 --> 02:03:17.390
Jeez.

02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:20.684
I really had to go today.

02:03:20.768 --> 02:03:22.603
You're getting way too comfortable here.

02:03:22.686 --> 02:03:24.397
Hey, wait for me!

02:03:28.359 --> 02:03:31.570
You used me as a pawn to move
that Japanese minister, didn't you?

02:03:32.613 --> 02:03:34.907
I wasn't entirely sure it would work.

02:03:35.783 --> 02:03:39.537
But you two just looked the most sincere.

02:03:47.837 --> 02:03:50.965
There's no way you don't
have a bathroom at home.

02:03:52.007 --> 02:03:54.385
Good news, bad news.

02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:57.221
Which one do you want first?

02:03:57.304 --> 02:03:59.348
Don't scare me like that.

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:04.520
It's better to take a hit first.

02:04:06.063 --> 02:04:08.983
Then we'll start with the bad news.

02:04:16.574 --> 02:04:19.827
They landed in Pyongyang yesterday.

02:04:20.453 --> 02:04:25.040
They'll be returning the Deputy Minister
and the pilots safely too.

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:28.377
That's great.
Then why is this the bad news?

02:04:29.879 --> 02:04:32.590
We got some intel
from our spies over there last night.

02:04:33.215 --> 02:04:35.509
All the guns and bombs they had…

02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:38.304
were fake.

02:04:41.724 --> 02:04:42.600
What?

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:45.394
That makes no sense.

02:04:47.396 --> 02:04:49.273
We never intended

02:04:50.816 --> 02:04:52.485
to kill the passengers.

02:04:54.111 --> 02:04:56.071
If we couldn't make it to Pyongyang,

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:59.325
we had resolved to take our lives
with the Japanese sword.

02:05:03.037 --> 02:05:05.664
That was our Plan B.

02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:09.960
Then we ended up saving their lives.

02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:12.838
What about the good news?

02:05:14.048 --> 02:05:16.175
It's about the president's hangover
from yesterday.

02:05:16.258 --> 02:05:18.344
It seems that he had a drink
with the US ambassador.

02:05:18.427 --> 02:05:23.641
Turns out the US will begin talks
with the Soviets.

02:05:23.724 --> 02:05:25.059
A good thing, to be sure.

02:05:25.142 --> 02:05:28.896
At that rate, we could also eventually
reunify with North Korea.

02:05:29.647 --> 02:05:31.190
Isn't that good news?

02:05:36.403 --> 02:05:39.865
So you're saying that if we beef
with North Korea, it upsets the US?

02:05:40.366 --> 02:05:41.450
Is that it?

02:05:41.534 --> 02:05:43.327
You sure catch on quickly.

02:05:45.913 --> 02:05:48.457
Officially, our government
was never involved.

02:05:51.585 --> 02:05:53.420
Don't be ridiculous.

02:05:54.547 --> 02:05:57.132
Like the North is going to believe that
after all that ruckus.

02:05:57.967 --> 02:06:01.679
They need to play along
because the Soviets want it that way too.

02:06:08.561 --> 02:06:09.603
Then…

02:06:12.606 --> 02:06:14.108
what about my promotion?

02:06:15.442 --> 02:06:16.860
And my medals?

02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:20.614
Are they all gone too?

02:06:22.658 --> 02:06:24.451
Even the interview you gave today…

02:06:26.537 --> 02:06:29.873
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.462
How the fuck is this good news?

02:06:40.968 --> 02:06:44.471
Everything ended well, and nobody died.

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:48.559
Including you.

02:06:55.274 --> 02:06:57.693
You're threatening me
to keep my mouth shut, aren't you?

02:06:58.444 --> 02:07:00.029
And what if I won't?

02:07:03.407 --> 02:07:05.034
You know what will happen.

02:07:18.756 --> 02:07:20.507
Is this how you always felt?

02:07:23.719 --> 02:07:25.471
I told you.

02:07:26.513 --> 02:07:28.015
It's still the moon.

02:07:31.685 --> 02:07:35.606
It doesn't need a name
in order to exist.

02:07:37.566 --> 02:07:41.320
It also doesn't need to be recognized
to hold meaning on its own.

02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:44.573
What you did,

02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:47.910
in itself,

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:51.121
was worthwhile.

02:08:54.601 --> 02:08:59.732
The heroes who saved
over 100 passengers have returned.

02:08:59.815 --> 02:09:02.109
Shinichi Ishida,
the Deputy Minister of Transport,

02:09:02.192 --> 02:09:05.946
exchanged himself for the hostages
at Kimpo, Korea,

02:09:06.029 --> 02:09:08.449
and saved 106 lives.

02:09:08.532 --> 02:09:12.077
Our heroes, Captain Takahiro Kubo
and co-pilot Seigo Maeda,

02:09:12.161 --> 02:09:14.204
made an emergency landing in Itazuke

02:09:14.288 --> 02:09:17.416
and saved 23 lives.

02:09:17.499 --> 02:09:19.251
No, I don't deserve to be called a hero.

02:09:20.294 --> 02:09:22.421
As Japan's Deputy Minister of Transport,

02:09:22.504 --> 02:09:23.422
I simply did my duty.

02:09:23.505 --> 02:09:25.674
After enduring 10,000 flight hours,

02:09:26.675 --> 02:09:28.051
I have incurred hemorrhoids.

02:09:30.345 --> 02:09:31.722
But right now,

02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:35.309
I am proud of them.

02:09:35.893 --> 02:09:38.687
It was an honor to serve alongside
your hemorrhoids, Captain!

02:09:50.449 --> 02:09:53.410
"Sometimes the truth
lies on the far side of the moon."

02:09:54.203 --> 02:09:57.080
"But that doesn't mean
what's on the near side is fiction."

02:09:57.748 --> 02:09:59.500
By Truman Shady.

02:10:00.751 --> 02:10:01.710
Right…

02:10:05.047 --> 02:10:07.841
-It's still the moon.
-I'd like to confess something.

02:10:07.925 --> 02:10:11.929
I did not know that quote by Truman Shady.

02:10:12.012 --> 02:10:14.223
-Of course not.
-It's still the moon.

02:10:14.306 --> 02:10:17.017
He never said such a thing.

02:10:17.518 --> 02:10:18.477
Ta-da.

02:10:21.855 --> 02:10:22.940
By the way,

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:25.609
why did you choose that name,
of all names?

02:10:25.692 --> 02:10:27.653
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
CHOI GO-MYUNG

02:10:29.613 --> 02:10:30.614
Just because.

02:10:33.242 --> 02:10:36.411
So you want to know
who Truman Shady is?

02:10:39.081 --> 02:10:40.624
What does it matter?

02:10:41.333 --> 02:10:42.626
He's just…

02:10:43.252 --> 02:10:44.586
Nobody.

02:16:01.194 --> 02:16:03.071
