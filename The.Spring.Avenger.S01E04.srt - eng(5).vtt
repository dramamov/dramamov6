00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720
Mr. Mu doesn't want to hear nonsense.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.200
Then what does he want to hear?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.160
Sweet talk?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.220
What are you two doing?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.519
Miss Gu.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.160
Mr. Mu and I

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.220
were just talking.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.320
Please don't

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.200
misunderstand.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
Why so nervous?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.280
Did I say anything about you two?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.240
Qiushan.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.400
I trust your judgment.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.850
He definitely won't get involved with

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.600
such a messy woman.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.289
It's not worth getting entangled.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.400
Mr. Jiang.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.450
You can go ahead with your work.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.960
What brings you here?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.200
Isn't Weiwei's birthday coming up?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.800
I specially picked out a gift

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.140
and wanted to give it to her early.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.400
Weiwei is upstairs.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.860
You can go up first.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.600
Hello?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.360
Mr. Mu.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.400
I've checked all the car dealerships in Shangcheng.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.520
No leads related to that accident from years ago.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.040
Expand the search area.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.000
No matter what it costs,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.400
we must find the person responsible.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.130
Understood.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.079
Weiwei.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.680
I bought you a birthday present.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.820
Take a look. Do you like it?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.120
How is it?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.600
Isn't it beautiful?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.320
- I hate it!
- I hate it!

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.850
All dolls can go to hell!

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.240
What are you doing?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.040
Weiwei!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.400
Weiwei!

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.120
Stop this nonsense.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.320
Apologize to Mrs. Gu.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.720
No!

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.200
I hate her!

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.560
I hate you too!

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.360
If my parents were still alive,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.040
they would never treat me like this!

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.320
Weiwei!

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.200
What are you laughing at?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.400
Weiwei.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.000
Weiwei.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.680
Stop fooling around.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.480
Open the door.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
No, no.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.320
Uncle always says no.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.160
Go away.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.200
I don't want you.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.520
I want Ms. Jiang.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.880
All right.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.320
I'll go get her.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.200
Vivi was traumatized as a child.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.079
She gets triggered whenever she sees dolls.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.000
Gu Nian.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.040
Before you try to butter someone up,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.120
couldn't you check what they're sensitive about?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.440
Now you've ended up shooting yourself in the foot.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.440
Isn't that funny?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.800
Nonsense.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.820
There's no such weird condition.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.400
You must be scheming behind my back again,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.930
trying to ruin my relationship with Qiushan.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.760
How dare you fight back.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.480
What are you trying to do?

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.240
Gu Nian.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.200
You think I'm still

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.460
the same Jiang Chunyu from ten years ago?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.240
For all the evil you've done to me over these years,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.000
I will make you pay for each and every one of them.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.260
You wouldn't dare.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.880
There are cameras everywhere.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.880
And Qiushan will be back any minute.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.440
If you lay a finger on me,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.200
I will

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.040
make you pay

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.720
a thousand times over.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.480
Fine.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.240
I have nothing to lose.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240
I have nothing.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.840
Do whatever you want.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.080
But you, Gu Nian, are different.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.280
You're a wealthy heiress.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.720
And a big celebrity.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.360
With a handsome and rich fiancÃ©.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.200
What would happen if you

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.520
lost all of that?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.320
Jiang Chunyu.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.200
You think this is enough

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.840
to threaten me?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.560
Unless you kill me right here and now.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.000
Otherwise,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.920
I could crush you back then.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.760
And I can do it now too.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.880
Is that so?

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.760
Well, in that case...

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.560
Miss Gu,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.800
would you like some fruit?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.730
It's very sweet.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.160
Thank you.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.280
Qiushan,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.960
I have something to take care of.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.159
I'll head back first.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.200
Tell Weiwei

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.440
on her actual birthday,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.450
I'll give her another gift.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.200
Alright, go ahead.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.280
Mr. Mu.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.520
Where's Weiwei?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.840
She locked herself in the storage room

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.760
and refuses to come out.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.720
Don't worry.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.930
I'll go check on her.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.480
Sis.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.810
Why are you back so early today?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.040
You're hurt.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.120
Who did this?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.800
Jiang Chunyu?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.160
I'll chop her hands off!

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.640
Wait.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.880
Let's go back and talk about it later.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.320
I'm arranging a live interview tomorrow.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.370
Don't let her find a chance to sabotage it.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.120
No more crying, okay?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.840
Uncle only cares about his company and stocks.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.570
He doesn't care about me at all.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.840
Your uncle actually loves you very much.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.840
You'll understand when you grow up.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.920
Having family by your side

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.400
is such a precious and fortunate thing.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.880
Mr. Mu.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.730
Where's Weiwei?

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.800
She's asleep.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.720
Ms. Jiang.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.760
You're being quite bold, aren't you?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.760
What?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.000
Mr. Mu wants to fire me.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.560
People who don't follow the rules

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.720
I cannot tolerate.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600
Mr. Mu, you're so cold-hearted.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.480
I worked until midnight,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.540
only had half a glass of your wine,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.100
and didn't even get overtime pay.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.200
Jiang Chunyu.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.159
What exactly do you want from me?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.000
Didn't I tell you before?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.840
I want...

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.240
You.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.610
But unfortunately,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.040
Mr. Mu is already taken.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.940
I won't be the other woman.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.600
Welcome to today's live interview.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.640
Today we have invited the actress Ms. Gu Nian,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.520
who has recently been caught in a bullying controversy.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.400
I'm sure she has a lot to say

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.200
to the fans who have been supporting her all along.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.400
I don't know who I've offended.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.780
Someone has fabricated videos to defame me.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.440
Please believe me.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.240
I would never do those terrible things.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.600
Indeed.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.160
Those who spread rumors are truly despicable.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.000
So to help everyone better understand

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.400
the truth of this matter,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.200
we have invited

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.920
Gu Nian's high school classmates and homeroom teacher.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.200
Let's hear

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.360
what they have to say about Gu Nian.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.600
Gu Nian was always very kind to her classmates.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.640
especially those

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800
from disadvantaged families.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.450
Everyone really liked her.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.600
Mr. Wei.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.240
I heard that student Gu Nian

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.400
has excellent academic performance at school,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.200
is that right?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.320
This child Gu Nian

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.720
is very humble.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.010
Although her family is very well-off,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.120
she's still hardworking and studious.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.650
She has consistently maintained the top position in her grade.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.680
Teacher.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.960
I'm clearly the one who ranked first.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.220
Why is it Gu Nian's name

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.360
on the honor roll?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.360
Jiang Chunyu.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.180
Don't make trouble for no reason.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.280
You should know your place

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.340
and what kind of family you come from.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.240
Your mother just sells pancakes for a living.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.360
Being in the top ten of your grade

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.280
is already a stroke of luck for you.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.480
Don't be ungrateful.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.860
What's wrong with selling pancakes?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.040
Does a pancake seller's daughter

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.720
not deserve to ask for fairness?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.960
You're a teacher

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.160
yet you help students cheat.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.090
I'm going to report you to the school leadership.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.880
Do you know what kind of school this is?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.210
Old Mr. Gu is a board member of this school.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.240
The annual donation he gives to the school

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.640
is more than your mother could earn selling pancakes for ten lifetimes.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.280
Even the principal doesn't dare to offend him.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.720
Who do you think you are?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.880
Then I'll report to higher authorities.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.000
I don't believe

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.600
I can't get a fair chance.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.640
How dare you!

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.570
Reporting to higher authorities?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.400
You ungrateful little brat!

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.840
Run ten laps around the playground.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.970
Make it thirty laps!

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.360
You're not going home until you finish.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.520
Go! What are you standing there for?
