WEBVTT

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.800
Meng.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.840
Meng.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.880
Hang in there.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.920
We'll go to the hospital right away.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.800
Right now.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.120
I got the patent.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.680
Let's go to the villa for my sister first.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.600
At a time like this,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
why do you still care about her business?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.730
If you won't take me,

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.039
I'll go by myself.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.039
Fine.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320
Whatever you say.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.720
After we give her the stuff,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.720
we'll go straight to the hospital for a checkup, okay?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.259
Where's the stuff?

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.280
Finally got the upper hand.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.080
Jiang Chunyu,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.280
let's see how you can fight me now.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.200
Xiaomeng!

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.000
Xiaomeng, what's wrong?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.960
Xiaomeng,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.080
what's wrong?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.960
What's wrong with Xiaomeng?

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.440
He just had a car accident.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.760
Xiaomeng must have internal injuries.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.759
What are you waiting for?

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.199
Get him to the hospital now!

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.840
Sis.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.200
What you wanted,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.600
I've given you.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.280
No!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.160
Xiaomeng!

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.200
Xiaomeng!

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.920
Xiaomeng!

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.840
Didn't you promise me

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.120
that you wouldn't leave me?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.320
Didn't you promise your sister

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.079
that you'd protect me forever?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.500
I can only accompany you this far.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.360
Fangyue.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.560
Fangyue.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.640
I'm here.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.280
Xiaomeng.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.280
Xiaomeng.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.880
Gu Nian.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.970
It's all your fault.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.040
It's all your fault, you bitch.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.480
You not only killed my child.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.280
You also got Xiaomeng killed.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.160
Why wasn't it you who died?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.140
You're the one who should die.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.200
Why don't you just die?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.560
Go to hell.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.640
Gu Xiaomeng.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.120
Didn't I tell you long ago

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.720
to leave this bitch sooner?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.240
But you wouldn't listen to me.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.720
You deserve it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.240
You deserve it.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.480
Xiaomeng

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.840
Xiaomeng

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.560
Xiaomeng

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.520
Xiaomeng

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.120
Xiaomeng

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.440
Now I'm the only one left.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.280
Miss.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.080
The company called to say

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.000
today is the shareholders' meeting.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.760
They're asking if

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.820
you plan to attend.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.960
Tell them

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.120
I'll be there on time.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.680
Since we've come this far,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.720
no matter what,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.200
I will never admit defeat.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.880
Are you sure you don't need me to accompany you?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.080
Gu Xiaomeng is dead.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.720
I'm afraid Gu Nian might become desperate.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.720
Really, there's no need.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.760
Today is the final showdown between Gu Nian and me.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.600
I want to face it alone.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.320
It's time.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.770
Shouldn't we start now?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.440
10 minutes after the meeting starts,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.880
if someone hasn't shown up,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.760
they'll be considered to have forfeited their inheritance rights.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.000
Miss Gu is probably busy with funeral arrangements

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.920
and won't be coming.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.280
Who says I'm not coming?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.320
This contains the Mu family's patented core technology.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.840
From today on,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.600
it belongs to our Gu Corporation.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.000
Miss Gu,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.640
do you have the authorized transfer documents?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.760
If not,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.340
this doesn't seem proper.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.520
Indeed,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.159
this really isn't following protocol.

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.000
Yes, exactly.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.320
This truly isn't proper procedure.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.680
That's right,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.340
authorized transfer documents are mandatory.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.520
When you worked with my grandfather

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.040
back then,

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.360
were you this timid as well?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.600
The agreed condition was to obtain the patent.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.880
As for how we get there,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.240
it doesn't matter.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.800
Jiang Chunyu.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.120
What are you laughing at?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.200
Miss Gu truly lives up to her acting background.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.640
Taking a stolen fake patent

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.640
and daring to submit it to the board.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.440
And still acting so righteous

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.560
that one can't help but admire your nerve.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.880
What makes you say my patent is fake?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.640
Because

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.540
the real one is with me.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.200
But unlike you...

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.679
I have Mu Qiushan's

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.120
personally signed authorization transfer document.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.450
It's completely legal.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.320
Miss Gu,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.330
you're not taking us shareholders seriously at all.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.720
So you and that bitch Fang Yue

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.020
are working together.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.000
Miss Gu,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.760
something terrible has happened!

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.120
There are many police officers downstairs.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.280
They said there are several cases

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.760
that need your cooperation at the police station.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.560
[Police]

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480
Why panic?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.280
It's just an investigation.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.680
I'll be back soon.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.000
Wait.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.400
To prevent Miss Gu from suddenly disappearing,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.060
I'll have someone follow you,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.420
and protect your safety at the same time.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.160
Wait a second.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.100
I need to use the restroom.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.120
Well...

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.480
What?

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.840
You're really treating me like a criminal.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.440
Who knows who'll be running this company in the future.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.800
It's not decided yet.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.600
Why are you here?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.050
Where's Gu Nian?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.850
She went to the restroom and hasn't come back yet.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.000
It's so cold today.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.280
I think it's going to snow heavily.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.040
When that happens,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.240
I want to build a snowman with Mr. Jiang.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680
How's it going?

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680
Any news?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.440
The nanny said it happened too suddenly.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.200
She couldn't see who attacked them.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.260
Seems the kidnappers came prepared.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.480
I suspect this

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.560
has something to do with Gu Nian.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.690
It was her after all.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.480
I'll go stall her.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.610
You call the police.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.440
No way.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.520
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.120
Weiwei could be in danger at any moment.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.450
We can't take that risk.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.920
Besides, Gu Nian and I

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.450
need to settle things once and for all.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.720
Stop it!

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.720
Don't hit my mom!

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.360
Mom!

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.680
Weiwei!

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.600
Weiwei!

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.560
Jiang Chunyu.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.200
You finally came.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.280
Let Weiwei go.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.240
If you have a problem, come at me.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.080
Fine.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.400
Jump from here.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.290
I'll release her immediately.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.460
Do you still think I'm stupid?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.050
Do you think I'd still believe you?

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.320
If you don't jump,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.160
I'll kill her right away.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.320
Fine.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.480
I promise you.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.010
Don't be afraid.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.640
Jump now!

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.960
You always talk such a good game.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.920
Why are you such a coward

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.620
when death is staring you in the face?

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.200
Even if I die today,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.080
you won't escape.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.010
The police are on their way.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.200
Jiang Chunyu.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.480
I came here today

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.760
with no intention of leaving alive.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.840
But you

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.920
must die before me.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.440
Why are you so lucky?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.200
Born with a silver spoon.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.880
Having a loving family.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.040
And Mu Qiushan who loves you so much.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.000
But I

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.680
have been living in the mud since childhood.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.920
No matter how hard I try,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.440
there's always an invisible hand

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.440
pulling me back down.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.080
Why is life so unfair?

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.560
Don't blame everything

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.240
on fate.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.600
Everything that happened

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.760
is the consequence of your own actions.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.800
My mother,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.560
Old Mr. Gu,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.960
they all died by your hand.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.200
It's too late for words now.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.000
If ten years ago,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.680
when you first met me,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.540
you hadn't harbored such evil thoughts,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.820
perhaps things would have turned out differently.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.080
I have nowhere to go now.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.840
Jiang Chunyu.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.520
Let's die together.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.720
Vivi, stay back!

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.680
Are you crazy?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.600
Chunyu.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.080
Chunyu.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.120
Qiushan.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.250
I've finally avenged my mother

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.520
and my grandfather.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.200
It's all over now.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.360
We can go back to our normal lives.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.880
Thank you.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.520
Mr. Jiang.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.960
Thank you and Mr. Mu

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.840
for everything you've done for the children.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.960
You're truly a loving couple.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.260
It's what we should do.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.120
Chunshan Children's Home

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.080
is officially established.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.760
That's wonderful!

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.760
So great!

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.920
Let's go in and take a look.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.980
Please, after you.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:21.920
Come.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.720
Mu Qiushan.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.400
You're painting so enthusiastically by yourself.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.120
It seems that I, as your model,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.610
am falling out of favor.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.760
Chunyu.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.240
Your every expression

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.320
is etched in my memory.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.160
I could paint you for a lifetime.
