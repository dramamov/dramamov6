00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.960
Mr. Li,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.439
I have a few questions for you.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.119
Mr. Li.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.240
Is it true
that you shot Commander Jiang dead?

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.799
Mr. Li, please answer my question.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:43.039
Mr. Li.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.600
Rumors say that you admire Miss Lu.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.280
Your lust for her
caused you to kill someone.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.439
Do you have anything
to explain to the people?

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:50.399
Everything you've heard is not true.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.640
I hold responsibility
for Killing Commander Jiang.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.850
It has nothing to do with other people.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.240
I will
give the public an explanation later.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.479
All of you are professional reporters.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.240
Thrusting someone into the spotlight

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.399
might not be too appropriate.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.479
If there's nothing else,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.719
please go back.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:05.959
Mr. Li, say something.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.359
Is this true?

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.480
Is this true?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.480
Wait for me at home.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:11.879
I will deal with this.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:16.239
Send Miss Lu back.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.760
Yes.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.660
Mr. Li, are the rumors true?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.460
Mr. Li, answer me.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.840
Mr. Li, please answer my question.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:29.040
Mr. Li!

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.480
Boss,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.599
you killed someone in the Mortal Realm for her.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.200
I have a bad feeling about it.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.120
This is bad.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.879
The Supreme Priest
has come to the Mortal Realm.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.120
Li Motong.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.159
You broke the Wujian Rules
because of Lu Huayan

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.439
and got struck by lightning.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.000
Is this even worth it?

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:46.520
It is.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.840
We meet again, Miss Lu.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.840
Mr. Jing,

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.409
you keep trespassing on my house
time and again.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.599
Why are you doing this?

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.919
Of course, it's for your Mei pearl.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.240
Mei pearl?

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.000
I don't think so.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.120
I think

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.479
I'll kill you first!

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.080
He even gave you a gun.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.520
How loyal.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.680
What are you trying to do?

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.240
Let go of me!

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.840
Li Motong will die without Mei pearl.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.800
You are just a petri dish
for the Mei pearl

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.919
yet you keep putting him in danger.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.080
You are an evil woman.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.240
You were trying to kill me
a few days ago.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.280
Your words cannot be trusted.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.800
You don't believe me?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.479
Li Motong killed Jiang Mingfeng.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.319
He is now being punished at Wujian.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.280
Do you want to see it?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.479
He's being punished?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.719
Where is he?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.000
Where is he?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.240
You want to see it?

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.800
I'll bring you there.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.479
Li Motong!

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.000
Yan.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.399
Li Motong.

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.639
Jing Haisi, why did you bring her here?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.720
Li Motong!

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:21.920
Take her away!

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.480
Look at the disaster you bring.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:27.240
Do you see how much suffering
you've caused him?

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.439
Yan, leave.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.439
Yan!

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.639
How can all of you be so cruel?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.120
Let him go!

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.000
Aren't you quite capable?

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.079
Save him yourself.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.399
Yan, leave now!

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.519
He has endured so much pain for you.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.199
He even kneeled to me

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.600
for your soul.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.399
Without your Mei pearl,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.920
he will die soon.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.199
I'm the one being punished,

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.000
not him.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.839
Jing Haisi, let go of him.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.350
I'm willing to be punished on his behalf.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.879
Sure.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.680
Kneel down, then.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.959
Beg me.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:29.319
Jing Haisi, you...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Don't listen to him.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.839
No.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.399
No, Yan!

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.199
Don't kneel to him, Yan!

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.399
I beg you.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.839
Please save him.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.000
How sincere.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.839
I beg you.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.680
Please save him!

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.120
However, you kneeled for nothing.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.480
I was just fooling around with you.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.600
What must I do for you to let go of Yan?

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.720
Li Motong.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:12.120
I won't take her away.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.399
I'm going to let her be punished
together with you.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.120
I won't kill her.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.639
However, I have
thousands of ways to torture her.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.600
Humans are lowly.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.240
She is just a vessel for the Mei pearl.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.000
Death is her only fate.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.839
I've told you

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.000
that the Mei pearl is my matter alone.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.040
I don't need you to interfere.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.720
Jing Haisi,

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.439
I order you as the Lord of Wujian

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.040
to get out of Wujian

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.519
and never come back.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.120
As expected of my younger brother.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.000
You are the Lord of Wujian indeed.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.519
This is not over between us yet.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.160
Li Motong.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.920
For you,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.120
everything I do is worth it.

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.399
Thank you,

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.000

that if you insist on
not taking the Mei pearl,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360
you will really die.

But you...

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.360
You kneeled to Jing Haisi

to get my soul back.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.000
You also killed a human to protect me
