Take your time.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.120
I've never had such delicious food.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.200
Now I see why you refuse to go back.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.760
Alright.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.360
Eat well.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.880
Finish it, then go back.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.600
Tell that person I'm already gone.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.440
I wouldn't dare say that.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.960
I'd rather stay locked up here

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.460
than going back and getting hit.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.880
It's right here.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.800
I smell someone sneaking bites inside.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.640
Stop eating.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.220
Come on, let's go.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.040
Could there really be a bandit hiding in?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.560
Let's open it and see.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.720
(If we really find the bandit,)

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.080
(Fu Qinghuai's identity)

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.280
(will likely be exposed.)

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.920
(How will I face them)

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.520
(and explain this to the children?)

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.680
Tangbao, be good.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.520
Go wait for Mother outside, alright?

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.400
Alright.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.920
Sanniang.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.600
With people coming and going here,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.240
how could someone hide in here?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.280
That's where you're mistaken.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.920
It's called the blind spot.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360
Those bandits are desperate men.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.600
They're capable of anything.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.160
We have to stay wary of them.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.320
Mountain bandits

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.840
are not necessarily all bad.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.120
Perhaps...

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800
Maybe they had hardships in the past

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560
and have now turned over a new leaf.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.480
Qingqing, why are you speaking
in their defense?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.520
I...

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.200
Hey,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.640
did... did you hear that?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.040
Someone is inside.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.120
Let's report it.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.920
We can't.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.000
If this blows up,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.440
it'll be bad for business.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.960
Let me handle it.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.400
Alright.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.440
Listen up, little bandit.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.440
We know you are inside.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.720
Don't you try to run.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.160
We're coming in now.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.960
See?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.720
I told you there was no one.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.480
Guess I was just imagining things.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.840
Sanniang, let's restock the vegetables.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.040
Don't keep the guests waiting.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.410
- Quick.
- Alright.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.000
Even if I keep quiet,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.000
others sent will still find this place.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.760
Unless you and Young Madam

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.680
can keep hiding.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.760
If they find you,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.760
then it'll be...

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.560
(I can't hide it anymore.)

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.960
Qingqing.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.420
I need a word with you.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.860
I need to handle the chicken.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.880
Maybe later.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.680
Take care.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.040
Make way, make way!

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.400
Hot. It's scalding!

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.480
Sanniang, are you calling me?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.400
Qingqing.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.680
I need a word with you.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.000
I still have a few accounts to settle.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.280
Let's talk later.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.060
We can check the accounts later.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.400
"The waterfowl would coo;

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.320
Upon an islet in the brooks."

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.000
Fan Ruolin.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.600
Everyone's here.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120
What brings you here?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.480
At such an ill-timed moment.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.160
Sanniang.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.680
Look.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.680
The weaving maiden by the river.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.480
The cowherd by the riverside.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.990
You are the weaving maiden,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.680
and I the cowherd who stands behind you.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280
My heart is not a stone.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.120
It cannot be changed.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.760
Heart? Stone? What nonsense is that?

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.840
Such pretentious words.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.920
Spout them somewhere else.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.240
Go, go, go.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.280
I'll recite you another verse.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.480
Carry on, you two.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.640
I don't want to hear it.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.760
Stop talking, let's go.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.400
Qingqing.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.280
What I have to say is important.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.160
You saw, just now, that person...

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.840
That… Fan Ruolin...

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.600
Truly, that was ill-timed.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.600
Qinghuai, you must never follow...

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.120
his ways.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.840
When is the right time, hmm?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.080
I'm about to earn enough to buy back

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.000
Fengyang House.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.120
Such a joyous, worthy celebration.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.560
I want to welcome it

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.720
with my children.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.990
As for everything else,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.320
let's set it aside for now.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.760
Alright?

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.160
Fine.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.000
I'll listen to you.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.320
Mother.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.160
What's got you grinning like that?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.720
There's good news to announce tonight.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.690
Come on.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.560
Xiaosheng.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.560
Tangbao.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.000
What is it?

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.380
Don't you recognize me?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.200
I'm your father.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.160
What a bold trafficker you are!

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.330
Shout like that again

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400
and I'll report you.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.160
Hold it.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.520
You are...

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.960
He Qingqing, right?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.720
Who are you?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040
I'm Fu Qinghuai.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.160
Fu Qinghuai.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.000
Mother.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.440
Has this man lost his mind?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.320
How dare he pose as my father?

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.600
Back then,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.570
I was taken by bandits

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.780
on my way to the imperial exam.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.480
So I simply disappeared.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.720
On my way to the exam back then,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.600
I was seized by mountain bandits.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.200
They made me serve as a scribe

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.840
until I finally managed to escape.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.760
I know it's hard to believe.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.880
But...

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.440
the truth

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.720
is the truth

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.040
and cannot be false.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.680
Xiaosheng,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.880
didn't Mr. Fan say

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.280
you mustn't be late for the exam?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.760
Head to the academy first,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.600
then tell your father,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.160
a man claimed to be him

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.120
and came looking for us.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.600
- Xiaosheng.
- He still has classes to attend.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.000
If there's something,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.000
let's discuss it when we get home.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.440
Alright.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.700
Tangbao.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.160
Go play in your room, alright?

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.170
Okay.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.040
Go on now.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.840
Tangbao, she…

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.040
It's alright.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600
The child's just tired.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.880
I told her to rest inside.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.920
You say you're Fu Qinghuai.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.440
Do you have any proof?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.600
Normally,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.280
I keep the Fu Family Seal

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.400
with me at all times.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.280
But sadly,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
it was taken by bandits.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.280
So you have no proof then.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.120
Then how am I supposed to trust you?

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.400
Luckily,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.320
the imperial officials suppressing bandits

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.720
verified my identity

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.440
and had already

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.000
sent the document proving who I am

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.440
to the Village Chief.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.120
If you truly are my father,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.400
do you still remember what I asked you

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.200
to bring back when you left?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.320
Of course I do.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.120
So that's how it was.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.960
By the way,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.870
Xiaosheng asked you

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.200
to bring something back.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.320
Did you bring it?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.920
He's been talking about it lately.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.480
It's been so many years.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.000
How could I remember that?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.680
It's been sitting overnight.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.000
Let me fetch you a fresh pot.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.400
Here.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.160
Much obliged.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.200
Upon my return,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.320
I intend to sell off

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.720
the Fu Family estate

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.860
and take the children back to my hometown.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.320
That cannot be allowed.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.960
I won't agree to it.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.920
You won't agree?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.080
I am the master of the Fu Family.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.520
My word is final.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.520
You are merely a second wife.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.000
If you refuse,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.960
I can divorce...

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.440
you any time.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.960
You don't even know
what Xiaosheng wants.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200
Yet you try to fool me.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.400
Mother.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.960
Xiaosheng.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.600
Where's your father?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.440
They took him away.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.680
They said he was an imposter.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.080
Mother.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.800
They're lying, aren't they?

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.160
Xiaosheng.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.520
I can't give you an answer right now.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.320
But I will uncover the truth.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.320
My father

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.720
is not real?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.800
(Next Episode)
The fake Fu Qinghuai is in my custody.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.160
Someone has accused you both

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.320
of plotting together

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.320
to seize the Fu Family's assets.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.240
Take them away.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.840
Which means...

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.400
you really were a bandit.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.160
No matter what happens,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.840
I'll face it with you.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.400
Tangbao, from this moment on,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.800
trust no one else

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.320
but me.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.840
Xiaosheng!

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.880
Don't be afraid.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.040
Come home with me.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.880
They've been deceiving me all along.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.480
They're not my real parents at all.
