He gets bullied at school.

the insurance last time.

What about the compensation?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.400
Insurance is money paid
by the insurance company.

The construction site manager

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.360
promised to pay 50,000 in compensation.

he said the site ran out of money
and went bankrupt.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.560
So that 50,000 in compensation

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.960
just went down the drain.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.040
has some nerve.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.430
He cornered this colleague

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.960
in the underground garage,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.890
and mainly asked about

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.510
Wu Ximei's

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.549
insurance claim situation.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.480
Finally he said

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.080
Cao Xiaojun isn't dead.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.110
Here, look.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.169
This is the policy.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.440
Reporting,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.870
we found the suspected vehicle

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.120
near the apartment building
in Anhe Village.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.360
License plate found inside:

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.910
Qin K, 32393.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.160
Captain Ma,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.670
this whole area is

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.990
an urban village about to be demolished.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.550
There are still some residents inside,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.250
and the conditions are quite complicated.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.720
This place

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.550
is not far from Wu Ximei's home, right?

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.870
About two blocks away.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.080
Those of you

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.950
in uniform, stay in the vehicle.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.320
Keep watch on this tricycle

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.100
and the entrances and exits.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.600
Okay.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.630
Those in plainclothes,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.150
pair up.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.910
Search separately.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.200
Once you spot the suspect,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.030
report immediately.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.630
Tong Hao and I

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.030
will check out the main area.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.480
Alright.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.010
Alright.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.440
Let's go.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.440
Split up.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:10.910
Mentor,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.690
this demolition area is so big.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.670
If he's really hiding,

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.070
it'll be hard to find him.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:17.480
And why would he

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.940
choose this place to hide?

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.390
The terrain here is complex.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.670
Buildings are of different heights.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.440
If you asked him

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.000
to go directly to Wu Ximei's home,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.840
he wouldn't dare

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.900
even with 800 guts.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.350
He can only find a spot

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.080
where he can see Wu Ximei's house

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.000
from above,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.320
observe for a while,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320
wait for the right moment,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.580
and then make his move.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.030
Mentor.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600
In this small area,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.150
bullets can ricochet easily.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.150
You take the gun and go first.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.030
Give me the handcuffs.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.030
Hand me the cuffs.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.960
Suspect spotted in the northwest
corner of the demolition area.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.040
Block him over there.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.330
Stop running!

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.120
Freeze!

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.550
Stop!

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.270
Freeze!

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.270
Stop!

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.960
Stop!

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.450
Freeze!

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.590
Hands up. Squat down!

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.390
Mentor, move aside!

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.320
What are you all shouting about?

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.000
Don't fight,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.330
or I'll call the police.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.050
After him!

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.770
Tong Hao!

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.490
Tong Hao!

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.680
Tong Hao!

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.080
Mentor.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.540
How do you feel now?

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.270
Mentor.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.960
Where's my gun, Mentor?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.700
The gun is here.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.330
If you lose your gun,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.370
we're finished.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.890
Get up. Come on.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.560
Check where it hurts.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.870
It's fine.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.760
Are you dizzy?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.330
I'm not dizzy. I'm fine.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.620
I just went to the bathroom

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.630
and left the key in.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.490
When I came out,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.080
I saw him taking my motorcycle.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.620
My new leather jacket was still on it.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.440
Don't worry,

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.960
your motorcycle won't go missing.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.600
Later,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.840
come back to the station with my colleague

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.440
and give a statement.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.700
We'll help you find it.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.320
You must find it for me.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.780
We will.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.570
Definitely.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.110
[Yongshuo Construction Group]

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.270
Come on, run faster!

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.080
Come and catch me, Tianbao.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.750
Stop right there!

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.460
[Yongshuo Construction Group]

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.080
One.

Ten.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.330
I'm coming to catch you.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.960
Got you!

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.270
Over there.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.360
Got you!

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.120
He's over there.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.050
He's over there.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.850
He ran away scared.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.150
Come out.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.280
What did I say?

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.360
Is this a place where

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.560
it's hard to be found?

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.480
Tianbao,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.790
I miss you so much.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.000
Have you missed me?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.790
Uncle Ni,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.670
what happened to your face?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.000
Does it hurt?

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.070
It's nothing.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.900
I just bumped into something.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.200
Uncle Ni,

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.390
where have you been these days?

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.840
I was sick

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.510
and you didn't come to see me.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.390
I really wanted to see you,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.720
but you moved away.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.880
I couldn't find you.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.960
I've only just found you now.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.840
Where are your mom and dad?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.840
Mom went to buy medicine.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.240
I don't know where Dad is.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.010
Tianbao,

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.300
hide-and-seek isn't fun.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.600
Would you like to go

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.790
to a more fun place with me?

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.480
Yes.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.120
But that place is very cold.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.640
Let's go home

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.030
to get a warm coat, okay?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.510
Okay.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.060
Let's go

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.030
home.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.440
Tianbao.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.450
Tianbao, time for your medicine.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.240
Tianbao?

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.920
Tianbao?

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.920
Tianbao!

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.960

Ximei.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.310
Is Tianbao with you?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.480
I went to find the boat boss.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.160
Why would Tianbao be with me?

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.440
What's going on?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
While I was out buying medicine,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.110
Tianbao was gone.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.590
It's okay. Kids love to play.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.000
He probably went out to play.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.800
You stay home and pack up things.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.200
I'll go look for him.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.980
Have you seen Tianbao?

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.520
We were playing hide-and-seek,

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.210
and then we couldn't find him.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.350
Even when the game ended,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.440
he never came back.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.960
How long has it been?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.250
It's been a while now.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.120
Where were you playing?

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.340
Over there.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.300
None of you saw him?

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.200
No.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.590
Tianbao!

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.110
Tianbao!

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.460
Tianbao!

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.640
Uncle!

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.480
I saw him hide in the prefab house,

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.920
and then he left with a man.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.720
Is there a scar

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.070
on that man's head?

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.160
Yes, he has a scar.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.550
Uncle Ni.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.960
Do you live in here?

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.590
Yes.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.880
Hurry upstairs.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.880
It's so cold here.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.400
Hurry.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.370
The wind is strong.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:30.930
Yeah.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.200
It's cold, isn't it?

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.070
Yeah.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.650
Really cold.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.400
We're here.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.790
We're home.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.070
Come in.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.880
It's so cold.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.590
Uncle Ni,

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.570
do you live here now?

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:50.300
Yes.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.790
It's not as good as my home.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.960
Not as good as yours?

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.610
We're all family.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.580
There's no yours and mine, right?

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.490
Sit down.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.750
Uncle Ni,

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.930
I'm so bored.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.400
Do you have anything fun?

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.070
Yes.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.880
I'll get it for you, okay?

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.270
Okay.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.200
You sit here.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.720
Hurry up.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.350
My parents will

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.880
urge me to go home before it gets dark.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.070
-We're here...
-Wait for me!

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.750
Don't make noise.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.950
Wait for me to return.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.830
Look at you.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.110
When will you ever change

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.240
this impulsive personality of yours?

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.400
Why did you raise your gun this afternoon?

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.590
I just wanted

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.040
to scare him a bit.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.740
We were in the same line of fire!

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.140
You...

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.030
You scared me instead.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.200
We learned at the police academy

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.860
that you can only fire

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.880
under certain conditions.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.680
I was right there.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.960
You almost shot me.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.040
I'm sorry, Mentor.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.310
Mentor,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.510
tell me the truth.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.580
About Xu Qingli's escape,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.030
what's the worst that could happen to us?

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.850
At worst, dismissal.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.030
An official reprimand if it's less worse.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:54.750
If we're lucky,

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.510
we'll just be excluded

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.770
from year-end awards.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.610
And if it's more serious?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.400
Execution.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.360
You asked for the truth.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:11.960
Well, I...

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.480
No, I'm joking about execution.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.420
It'll be fine.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.660
Let's search along the way.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.520
Think about where he might go now.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.980
Try to make up for our mistake.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.420
What if we catch him?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.030
Wu Ximei's workplace

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.470
is close to Mount Fufeng.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.410
Anywhere else?

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.710
The insurance company.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.370
No, he can't go there a second time.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.640
The Yongshuo construction site.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.880
Ni Xiangdong and Cao Xiaojun

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.660
both worked there before.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.950
That abandoned building is where

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.200
that water dispute fight case happened.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.100
It's in Yongshuo, right?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:46.710
Yes.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.050
There are still some residents there.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.070
They bought pre-sale apartments

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.880
that haven't been delivered,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.480
so they just moved in anyway.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.730
Let's take a punt.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.240
Why is your phone here?

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.070
Tianbao

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.180
was taken by Ni Xiangdong.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.110
Ximei.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.270
Ximei.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.480
Tianbao!

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.220
Tianbao!

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.800
It's okay. I'll go find him.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.350
Tianbao.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.020
You go back first.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.240
Let's go.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.510
Ni Xiangdong!

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.380
Is Tianbao with you?

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.110
Let him go!

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.920
I'm begging you to let him go!

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.690
Our issues

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.960
should be resolved by ourselves.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.590
This matter

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.050
has nothing to do with the child.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.410
The child is innocent.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.590
I'm begging you.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.720
Please, I beg you to let him go.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.480
Okay?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.110
It's all my fault.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.240
It's all my fault.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.960
I'll give you my life instead!

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.200
Can you hear me?

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.240
I'm begging you!

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.310
Don't cry.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.750
-Let him go!
-Xiaojun, I know you're listening.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.480
You can have my life if you want.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.590
Ximei.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.280
-I'm begging you.
-Xiaojun.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:02.800
Ximei.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:03.850
Are we still brothers?

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.370
I'm begging you, Ni Xiangdong!

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.930
Your brother is in trouble now.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.660
Will you help me out?

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.350
I'm begging you!

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.070
Ni Xiangdong.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.680
It was me who did it.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.240
If you have a problem,

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.120
come at me.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.440
Tianbao is innocent.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.680
Innocent?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.070
I'm innocent too.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.750
He's innocent.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.790
I'm innocent too.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.240
Right?

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.200
What did I do?

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.310
Then was the person

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.510
who was buried in the pit you dig

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.400
innocent?

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.360
Was that person guilty?

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.510
Answer me!

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.320
Listen to me.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.560
I'll give you two places.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.840
One is the Chengxi construction site,

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.540
and the other is Mount Fufeng.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.640
Tianbao and I

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.160
will definitely be at one of these places,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.090
waiting for you.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.240
As for where each of you is going,

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.010
you need to decide quickly.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.240
Do you hear me?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.720
Hurry up.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.110
It's very cold here.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.270
Tianbao is also cold here.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.250
Isn't he?

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.350
Decide quickly.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:13.970
Ni Xiang-

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.720
Ximei.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.770
Ximei.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.240
Ximei, look at me.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.110
Tianbao.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.400
Look at me!

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.640
I'll go to Mount Fufeng.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.400
You go to the Chengxi construction site.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.680
I guess he'll be waiting for me
at Mount Fufeng,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.210
just like in the beginning.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.350
Do you hear me?

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.960
I'm going with you.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.710
We have nothing left to gamble.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.030
No time to hesitate, Ximei.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.540
I'll go to the construction site.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.000
You take the car.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.680
Alright.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.920
I'll go to Mount Fufeng.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.510
If I don't find them,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.920
I'll come straight
to the construction site to find you.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.110
Remember this.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.020
Safety first.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.130
Understand?

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.880
Xiaojun.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.440
Be careful.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.640
Get to Pier No. 3 by 10 PM

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.920
and find the boat boss.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.970
Just go as soon as the ship leaves.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:51.310
Okay.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.830
It's fine.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.780
I'm here.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.210
Tianbao will be fine.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.240
It'll be fine.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.400
It'll be fine.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.350
It'll be fine.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.030
When will my parents

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.390
come to pick me up?

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.560
Uncle Ni, why do we

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:19.750
have to make such an effort

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.680
to climb up here?

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.210
Are you afraid of heights?

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.000
Afraid?

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.350
Very soon.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.210
I just called

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240
your parents.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.640
They'll be here soon

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.590
to meet you.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.270
Tell me honestly.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.300
You don't want to move either, do you?

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.200
I want to set off firecrackers

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.160
with Lele and others during New Year.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:46.960
That's right.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.330

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.400
I'll go and try

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.450
to convince your parents, okay?

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.440
Okay.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.790
Dad will definitely listen to you.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.860
I have some misunderstanding

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.590
with your parents.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.640
They hate me now.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.540
But I didn't mean to hurt them.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.310
I want to apologize to them.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.520
If I apologize,

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.920
they'll be happy.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.170

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.260
Who are you really?

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:05.960
Who am I?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.280
I'm your brother Dong!

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.000
Ni Xiangdong!

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.110
Don't you recognize me?

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.190
Cao Xiaojun!

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.030
I'm your brother Dong!

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.630
Kill me again!

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.520
Kill me!

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.590
Do you hear me?

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.190
I've already considered you family.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.150
You know?

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.360
If you hadn't mentioned this,

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.160
I would never have brought it up.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.920
If you had been honest with me,

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.110
we wouldn't be here today.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.370
What a pity.

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.150
Right now,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.480
at the Chengxi construction site,

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.880
Wu Ximei has already

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.480
fallen from that scaffold.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.450
What have you done to Ximei?

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.190
What happened to her?
