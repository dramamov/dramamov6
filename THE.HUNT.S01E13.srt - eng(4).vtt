was clearly him.

Then his eye

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.750
started bleeding.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:58.890

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.510
Hello.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:01.920
Hello.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.130
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.160
Sure.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.030
What time did you finish work last Friday?

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.830
When you finished work,

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.160
what was Wu Ximei doing?

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.200
She should have been
in the Janitor's Room.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:13.590
At that time

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.590
she should have finished cleaning.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.410
When was

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.370
the last time you saw her

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.090
that day?

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.790
That day,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.280
I got home and

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.790
I found that I didn't
bring my USB drive with me.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.310
I was worried about
delaying my weekend work,

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.030
so I biked back to the office to get it.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.810
When I got the USB drive,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.650
Ms. Wu

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.270
was just coming out of the Janitor's Room.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.770
She was probably getting ready to leave.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.830
What time was it?

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.830
After 6.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.590
That fits.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.020
Those photos

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:41.780
were almost certainly

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.780
taken by Wu Ximei.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.840
There're...

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.110
There're cameras upstairs.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.070
The metadata on the photos

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.620
matches the camera model.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.680
She had plenty of time

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.310
to take the photos and come back.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.160
So Wu Ximei

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.760
deliberately ran into her colleague

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.310
to get an alibi.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.440
But isn't that too coincidental?

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.160
That's not important.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.880
Let me tell you.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.410
There are security cameras

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.030
on the main road

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.520
that can prove

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.350
when she left.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.790
She might have just taken a chance

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.310
and happened to run into someone.

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:08.350
Take that ear, for example.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.550
Could you have predicted

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.070
it would fall into the drain downstairs,

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.590
clog it up,

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.070
and someone would
find it and call the police?

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.790
No way.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.310
Besides,

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:18.960
even if the person downstairs

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.120
hadn't found the ear, it wouldn't matter.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.310
She could have reported it herself,

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.040
saying Cao Xiaojun was missing

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240
and she couldn't find him,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.640
then she could have led us to the place.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.840
The neighbor finding

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.550
the ear

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:29.160
at that time —
wasn't that also unexpected?

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.920
More or less.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.420
Everything Wu Ximei did afterward

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.200
was probably just

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.330
to cover up this unexpected event.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.720
She adapted to the situation.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.880
So even the memory card

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.680
being delivered to the neighbor

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.960
was planned in advance.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.160
The goal was to have an uninvolved person

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.290
deliver the evidence to us.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:40.720
Right.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.480
More natural

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.540
and more credible.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.750
These two went to great lengths

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.280
to commit insurance fraud.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.810
If Ni Xiangdong had died on Mount Fufeng,

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.550
they would have received

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.750
his insurance money.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.960
Then if Cao Xiaojun hid for a few years,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.440
he'd be declared missing.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.400
And they would also get

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.790
Cao Xiaojun's insurance money.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.750
But for all her calculations,

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.410
she didn't account
for Liu Cheng'an showing up.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.800
Wu Ximei is quite something.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.160
I think Cao Xiaojun is quite clever.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.000
That ear was most likely

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.060
cut off by himself.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.640
Losing so much blood,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.710
and being locked in that box,

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:11.920
he could have suffocated.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.880
It wouldn't matter if he died.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.420
Cao Xiaojun already had it planned out.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.030
The insurance money

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.490
was meant for Cao Tianbao.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.480
If something happened to him,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.950
this money

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.270
would be enough for Wu Ximei and the child

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:19.980
to get by.

then the people he's looking for

She asked about

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.650
the insurance matter.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.790
A few days ago?

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.050
What exactly did she ask about?

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.880
Well, well...

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.840
About her husband's

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.720
disappearance insurance claim.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.700
Did they get the money?

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:06.760
Of course not.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.410
It doesn't meet the claim requirements.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:13.890
Let me tell you something.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.610
Cao Xiaojun isn't dead at all.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.440
Shouldn't you

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.510
report this matter

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:22.800
to the police?
