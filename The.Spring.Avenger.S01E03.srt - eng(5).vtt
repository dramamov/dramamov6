00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.840
Help!

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.800
Shut up!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.280
Shut up! Help!

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.040
Shut up! Got it?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.489
I'll make you scream

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.120
enough.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.140
Scream!

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.080
Scream again!

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.080
Louder!

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.360
Bitch!

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.520
Enough!

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.200
Hey, sis.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.560
That's enough.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.440
Don't kill her.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.500
Come back quickly.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.600
Okay, I got it.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.560
Mr. Mu

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.080
What are you doing?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.920
Ms. Jiang

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.880
Who gave you permission

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.610
to take Weiwei out today without authorization?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.960
I'm sorry.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.280
I didn't expect

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.240
something like this would happen today.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.079
However, Mr. Mu,

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.720
shouldn't you also reflect on

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.579
your approach to raising Weiwei?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.000
Are you lecturing me?

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.680
I've given her the best of everything.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.740
Isn't that enough?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.760
But she's not happy.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.560
Can't you see that?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.480
Considering how you risked yourself today

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.760
to protect Weiwei,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.160
I'll let this matter go.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.420
If this happens again,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.400
I will fire you.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.200
Fine.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.240
But Mr. Mu,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.400
that person today had a weapon.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.060
Why didn't we call the police?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.960
Because the marriage alliance between the Mu and Gu families

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.420
is absolutely necessary.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
Let's go back now.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.000
Sis.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.360
Useless!

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.079
Sis.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.579
Use something to hit me

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.280
or you'll hurt your hand.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.680
I'm sorry, sis.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.360
I failed this time.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.920
Don't worry.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.440
Jiang Chunyu won't live much longer.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.240
Get out!

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.240
I don't want to see you right now.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.200
After college graduation

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.860
we lost touch with each other.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Only Gu Xiaomeng

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.020
remained Nian's loyal follower.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.400
Fang Yue was much closer to them.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.960
After all, she had been in love

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.960
with Gu Xiaomeng since high school.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.720
Half a month's salary gone again.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.000
When will I be like Gu Nian

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.170
who can buy whatever

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.680
she wants?

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.680
Meng.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.720
How could you?

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.800
Meng.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.560
You always do this.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.880
What am I to you?

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.680
Haven't you always known?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.440
Why act so sensitive now?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.760
But after all these years.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.320
Don't you ever?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.800
No.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.360
Nian,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.930
what brings you here today?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.360
Nian.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.760
You're truly pathetic.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.480
After all these years,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.400
you're still just someone's substitute in bed.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.800
So many people want to be your substitute,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.840
but they don't even qualify.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.640
Nian.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.120
The store just got some new limited edition products.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.650
I've saved them all for you.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.360
I brought them for you to see.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.960
Those shoes worked quite well.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.480
Get me a pair to try on.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.450
They're exactly your size.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.840
Indeed, without a good background

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.680
one has to suffer quite a bit.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.400
Just look at you.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.360
The skin on your face

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.600
is so rough,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.520
not even as soft as my feet.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.760
Yes.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.880
How could I compare to you, Sister Nian?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.600
You'd better know your place.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.000
Without me,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.240
you wouldn't even have the good life you have now.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.880
Plain 6 yuan + bacon 2 yuan, ham 2 yuan, sausage 2 yuan.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.240
Multigrain crepe.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.800
Multigrain crepe.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.640
What would you like on your multigrain crepe?

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.600
Jiang Chunyu is your daughter, right?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.640
Yes, she's my daughter.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.120
Did something happen to her?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.960
She upset Sister Nian.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.480
Isn't that a huge problem?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.280
Why waste time talking to her?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.040
Don't smash it!

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040
How could you do this?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.600
Stop it!

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.880
Get out of Shangcheng as soon as possible.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.890
I've completed this month's sales target for you again.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.760
You'd better be grateful.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.570
Thank you, Nian.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.360
Take care, Nian.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.240
Why did you come

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.840
to find me?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.600
I care about you.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.920
You must be joking.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.560
I never joke.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.240
Do you want to be bullied by Gu Nian for the rest of your life?

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.500
Let her humiliate you?

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.560
How dare you say that.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.840
If you hadn't run away ten years ago,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.760
I wouldn't be bullied by her now.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.960
When she bullies you,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.000
won't you fight back?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.240
How can I fight back?

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.380
Easy for you to say.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.640
See?

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.520
Fighting back is actually very simple.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.000
Just do what I do.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080
I'm warning you,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.650
don't try anything.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.400
Jiang Chunyu, let go of me.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.130
If you don't fight back,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.360
you'll be bullied forever.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.720
I'm not like you,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.980
all alone in the world.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.480
Besides,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.120
I have Xiaomeng.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.660
Why am I even telling you this?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.880
If you have nothing else,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.760
I'm leaving.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120
I can help you.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.880
Help me?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.760
What can you possibly do for me?

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.000
Don't you want Gu Xiaomeng

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.280
to leave Gu Nian?

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.480
We have a common enemy,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.690
so naturally we can work together.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.480
What do you want from me?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.200
Everything about Gu Nian.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.160
Sis.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.960
How's the situation

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.810
with that video being handled?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.520
I've already bought trending topics on all major social platforms.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.080
After a few days of counterattack,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.560
public opinion has shifted.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.840
To what extent?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.860
Everyone is saying that video

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.720
was fabricated by our competitor

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.720
just to compete with you for the female lead in the new drama.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.680
Now everyone

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.260
sympathizes with you.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.600
And now the production company

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.960
is reconsidering

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.800
having you play the female lead.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.060
Xiaomeng did a good job this time.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.640
He deserves encouragement.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.440
It seems Gu Nian is doing well

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.480
in the Gu family.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.880
I'm afraid

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.320
her good days won't last much longer.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.360
Old Mr. Gu

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.970
hasn't given up looking for his biological granddaughter.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.440
Jiang Chunyu.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.680
You can't die.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.480
You must survive

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.240
to punish those demons.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.480
Stop the car.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.570
Qiushan.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.520
You're back.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.520
This little brat.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.520
Brother.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.720
Brother.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.960
Brother.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.800
Brother.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.520
What's wrong, Mr. Mu?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.520
Cut the act.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.200
Sneaking around with a knife,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.360
what are you up to?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.290
I was cutting fruit for Weiwei.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.040
I saw you were asleep.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.760
Afraid you might catch cold,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.760
I wanted to cover you with a blanket.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.680
Jiang Chunyu.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.010
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.520
Who would believe such nonsense?

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.320
Mr. Mu.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.480
If Mr. Mu doesn't want to hear nonsense...

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.080
Then what would you like to hear?

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.040
Sweet talk?
