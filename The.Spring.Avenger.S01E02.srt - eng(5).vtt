00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.880
Didn't anyone tell you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.080
that first place

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.720
can only be mine?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.040
Who gave you permission

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
to score two points higher than me?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.640
I won't dare to do it again.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.400
Fangyue.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.600
Look at her.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.560
Her hair is a mess.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.440
Her face is dirty too.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.480
Help clean her up.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.260
What are you doing?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.760
Let go!

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.880
Come.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.770
Are you okay?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.400
Get up.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.860
Let's go together.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.920
Grandpa.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.600
The company will go public in six months.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Before that,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.759
the marriage alliance between the Gu and Mu families is imperative.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.490
You need to pay more attention.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.000
I know, Grandpa.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.280
Jiang Chunyu

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.560
Please spare me.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.720
It was Gu Nian and Gu Xiaomeng who forced me back then.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.000
If I didn't do what they said,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
they would have beaten me to death.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.320
I begged you all like this back then too.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.880
But not one of you,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.640
not once,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.840
showed me any mercy.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.720
Chunyu

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.000
I know I was wrong.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.280
I truly regret what I did.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.360
As long as you don't kill me,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.280
I'll do anything you want.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.000
Really?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.500
What if I ask you to betray Gu Nian?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.520
I heard you have a child,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.840
just 5 years old.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040
Why isn't that bitch Jiang Chunyu dead yet?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.920
Why is she still alive?

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920
She even dares to seduce Mu Qiushan.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960
She's not worthy.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:02:59.880
Sis.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.420
Don't be like this.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.080
It's not good if people downstairs hear you.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.480
Take your anger out on me.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.200
It's okay.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.610
I'm here for you.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.220
It doesn't matter who comes back.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160
You're right.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.200
She's just a grasshopper under our feet.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.079
She's just hopped around a bit more.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.370
We'll just step on her a few more times.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.840
If you want me to let you go

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.480
show me some sincerity.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.760
I have a video of her.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.480
Gu Nian asked me to record it for her back then.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.760
Maybe it can help you.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.560
Xiaomeng.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.080
Will you always stay by my side?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.520
Protect me?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.760
Help me,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.920
won't you?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.960
I swear.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.959
But what if

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.880
I marry Mu Qiushan?

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.080
Get some rest.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.980
We have a press conference tomorrow.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.640
Gu Nian!

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.240
Gu Nian.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.260
Let's go inside first.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.360
I'm terribly sorry

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.770
for frightening everyone.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.730
This industry is complicated.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.760
There's a lot of jealousy and sabotage.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.080
But for all of you,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.880
I will keep going.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.880
Stay strong!

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.000
We'll always support you!

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.800
Gu Nian!

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.760
Gu Nian.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.560
No wonder you're doing so well in showbiz.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.020
You're really successful

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.800
because your acting is impressive.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.760
Gu Nian!

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.360
Please give Miss Gu Nian some time to recover.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.120
Qiushan,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.360
could you come with me to change my clothes?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.880
Alright, let's first look at the information about this show.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.540
Please look at the big screen.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.610
Why is she hitting someone?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.880
Is that really Gu Nian?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.640
Oh my god!

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.780
How can she be this kind of person?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.320
When did this happen?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080
How could the Gu Nian I admire be such a person?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.000
No, Qiushan.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.040
This isn't me.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.159
This isn't me.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.880
No.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.159
It's not me.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.000
I mean,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.060
how could she do something like this?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.360
So all of this was just a persona.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.240
It's not me.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.080
Qiushan,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.440
this isn't me.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.880
This really isn't me.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.320
Get out of here.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.200
Get out. Get out. Get out.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.480
It's not me.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.000
Quit.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.960
Leave the industry.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.560
Just quit.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.440
Quit.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.420
Just leave.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.100
Get out.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.940
Go away.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.240
Mom.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.000
I've missed you so much.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.000
Mom.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.880
Mom.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.560
Gu Nian.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.160
All the pain I've endured

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.240
I'll make you pay for it all.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.320
Prepare to lose everything

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.360
and fall into hell.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.800
Breaking News

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.080
Gu Nian, known as the golden girl of the entertainment industry,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.560
was at her new drama press conference

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.080
when allegations surfaced that she bullied a female classmate in high school.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.640
The methods were reportedly extremely cruel.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.800
This incident has caused great outrage across society.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.200
People are demanding a public apology from Gu Nian,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.440
otherwise they will boycott all her works

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.770
along with the Gu Corporation behind her.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.360
You bastard!

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.120
You've caused such a big mess.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.919
If I had known,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.000
I should never have taken you

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.360
from the orphanage.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.919
Don't you dare hit her!

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.680
What?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.680
You mad dog, you want to fight me?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.240
Don't forget who raised you.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.240
Grandpa.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.280
This matter

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.440
is my fault.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.920
But don't worry,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.730
I can handle the PR quickly.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.000
We'll release a statement saying

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.160
the video was

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.210
fabricated to frame me.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.330
Grandpa, please calm down.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.240
Gu Nian.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.600
I brought you both back to the Gu family.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.560
It's just to prove

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.020
that my educational philosophy is correct.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.680
You must be the best.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.260
Do you understand?

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.960
I understand.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.780
Go explain to Qiushan now.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.860
Yes, Grandfather.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.800
Why are you following me?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.200
Qiushan.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.320
Gunian.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.240
It's so late.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.170
Why are you here?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.960
In the video from today's press conference,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.120
it really wasn't me.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.880
I swear to you.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.080
It's just a small matter.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.200
Nothing serious.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.490
As long as we can solve the problem.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.640
You should

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.800
take a shower and change your clothes before going back.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.560
Okay.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.200
Qiushan.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.440
We're not officially engaged yet.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.520
Is this

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.120
appropriate?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.810
Indeed, it's not appropriate.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.120
Jiang Chunyu.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.200
Miss Gu,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.700
is this all you've got?

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.640
It's really not impressive.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.320
Go to hell!

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.640
Gu Nian,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.460
did something happen?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.680
If you dare say one more word,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.900
I'll give all your dirt to Mu Qiushan.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.490
Let's see if he still dares to marry someone like you.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.200
Nothing.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.840
Your tutor was just

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.200
bringing me a towel.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.440
How did it go?

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440
Did he believe it?

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.320
I think so.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.080
What did you find out?

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.320
I've asked around everywhere.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.050
Only Xie Xiaoqi has this video.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.440
But Xie Xiaoqi and her daughter

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.680
have been missing for days.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.740
We can't find them.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.960
It must be Jiang Chunyu's doing again.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.240
That bitch.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.800
Must die.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.650
Anyone my sister doesn't like.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.040
Of course must die.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.720
Mr. Jiang, you play so beautifully.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.920
If you practice diligently,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.920
you'll play better than me someday.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.960
I don't want to practice.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.320
It's too tiring.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.580
How about this.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.800
If you can learn the second section today,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.080
I'll take you out to play.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.210
How does that sound?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.120
Let's go.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.300
Watch your fingering.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.600
Mr. Mu.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.530
Where is Weiwei?

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.560
Isn't she supposed to have violin lessons today?

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.480
Miss Jiang took her out.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.420
They went to buy some sheet music.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.960
He really came.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.080
Teacher, what's wrong?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.640
I'm fine.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.000
Weiwei.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.140
The scenery is beautiful.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.920
Let's take a photo together.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.600
Alright.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.370
Let's go.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.840
Bastard!

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.680
Uncle, stop fighting!

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.520
Weiwei!

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.600
Gu Xiaomeng!

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.920
What are you trying to do to Weiwei?

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.720
Xiaomeng,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.840
Mu Qiushan is going to be your brother-in-law.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.970
You can't touch him.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.760
Don't be so upset,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.400
Mr. Mu.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.080
I just noticed that this new tutor

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.280
is quite attractive.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.320
I just wanted to have some fun with her.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.080
Get out!

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.410
Stay away from them from now on,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.240
or I won't be so polite next time.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.240
Uncle.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.320
Weiwei.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.440
It's okay.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.320
It's alright.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.600
Everything's fine now.
