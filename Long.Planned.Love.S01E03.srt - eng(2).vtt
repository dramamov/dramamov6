(Jian Family)
Why did Zhou Yufeng cancel

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.240
(is big.)
the engagement?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.150
Sorry, really sorry.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.800
(Told you.)
Everyone, my apologies.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.695
(There's more)
We'll cancel

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:01.110
the engagement with the Jian Family.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.250
(to Jian Cheng's incident.)
The kids don't get along.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.710
You holding up okay?

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.040
This girl is driving me crazy.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.050
- Good.
- Such a good match.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.760
I was ready for this a long time ago.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.320
Really?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.680
Of course.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.320
Those people.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.640
Go ahead, laugh louder if they want.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.000
Once I marry you someday,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.400
I'll shove our marriage certificate

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.590
right in their faces.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.040
Alright.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.640
Why hold a press conference?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.950
For something like this,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.400
your Uncle Zhou finally agreed.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.620
We have to lock it in now.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.040
Otherwise, if Jian Cheng changes her mind,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.150
she'll be clinging to you.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.000
Will this ever end?

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.480
Everyone knows the engagement is off.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.680
If you ask me,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.560
Jian Cheng won't have the nerve

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.040
to bother you again.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.600
Mom.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.590
But how will we explain this to Uncle Zhou?

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.760
The press conference already happened.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.350
He wouldn't risk Zhou Family's dignity

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.310
for her.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.070
Jian Cheng.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.030
Come out here.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.590
We need to talk this through.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.470
It must've been that night,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.590
you made a mistake

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.400
and ended up upsetting Yufeng.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.310
You're already engaged.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.680
Why bother with that woman outside?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.120
Your sister already told you,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.870
Jiang Yawei is just from a small county.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.960
She'll never enter the Zhou Family.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.170
Can't you just

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.150
let it slide?

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.590
Let it slide?

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.280
Back then, Mr. Jian kept a college girl.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.080
She was from a modest family.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.150
Couldn't enter our family.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.590
Yet you went to her campus
to humiliate her.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.310
You even threw money in her face

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.660
and stirred up online harassment.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.960
Compared to you,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.280
I'm practically an angel.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.560
- You...
- Mom.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.400
What now?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.710
We both had been cheated.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.810
You couldn't stand it.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.150
So why should I play the saint?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.800
- Mom.
- I…

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.630
Want to silence me?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.030
Wenqian, help your mom back to her room.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.680
- You...
- Let's go, Mom.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.960
Come with me to apologize
to the Zhou Family.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.400
Go.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.960
Apologize?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.360
What, do I really have to marry Yufeng?

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.200
Yes.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.870
Before, you could mess around
all you wanted.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.030
But this time,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.310
you must apologize to them

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.150
and marry into the Zhou Family.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.280
Otherwise,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.560
I'll break your legs.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.080
Fine.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.240
Give me ten million.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.150
Ten million?

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.560
You need to buy a gift

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.120
to make amends.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.400
The Zhou Family is a rich family.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.810
Even ten million won't impress them.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.560
I'd have to chip in from my pocket.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.590
See how thoughtful I am.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.520
Alright.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.840
Gifts for others are easy to handle.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.120
But Grandpa Zhou's...

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.310
That's harder to find.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.870
Jian Youhui has lots of antiques.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.150
How about I pick one?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.710
Alright.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.710
Go ask your brother.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.360
If he says no,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.560
tell him to come to me.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.360
I'm truly sorry.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.460
If I'd known Jiang Yawei
could drive you crazy,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.220
I wouldn't have invited her
on my birthday.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.360
She's not the only one who makes me mad.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.400
You count too.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.510
You're insane.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.720
You pushed me over the edge.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.510
Just like you wanted.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.390
And you're not happy?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.240
You're really hard to please.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.840
You...

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.240
My dear sister,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.040
how did I never notice
you were this capable?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.240
Keeping Jian Youhui on the hook,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.510
while also coveting Zhou Tingyan.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.310
How did you...

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.950
Find out about your mess
with Jian Youhui?

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:10.870
Take a guess.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.150
Wenqian.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.040
We shouldn't keep making mistakes.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.510
Youhui, don't leave me.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.110
Jian Youhui.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.750
Mr. Jian said I can pick anything
from your collections.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.560
Jian Youhui.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.070
About Jian Wenqian,

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.000
I'd advise you not to walk into trouble.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.100
(Jian Youhui, Jian Cheng's brother)

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.830
Keeping Jian Youhui on the hook,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.920
while also coveting Zhou Tingyan.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.960
(Jian Cheng,)

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.000
(you pushed me into this.)

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.270
On Qin Zhuo's birthday banquet,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.870
if you don't want your dignity
stepped on,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.000
there's only one way.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.730
You'll have to take some heat.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.350
Alright.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.520
Go on.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.700
(Qin Zhuo's birthday banquet)

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.070
Jiang Yawei will apologize in public,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.310
all media set up already?

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.390
Of course.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.950
Just wait for tomorrow's trending.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.100
- Uncle Zhou.
- Qin Zhuo.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.110
Jian Cheng,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.200
you look amazing.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.230
Thanks.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.470
Zhou.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.960
Zhou.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.990
Zhou, we have a meeting to attend.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.950
What meeting?

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.240
No time, Zhou.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.080
Let's go.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.150
Tang.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.270
You're Qin Zhuo's fiancee.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.830
You should be by his side.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.830
Forget it.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.630
He doesn't like me following him.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.950
How would you know if you don't try?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.230
Tang.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.070
I hope

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.950
you get what you wish for.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.720
At least between the two of us,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.270
one of us should be happy.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.520
Go on.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.260
Miss Jian.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.200
You have a visitor.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.710
Me?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.040
Yes.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.160
Jiang Yawei.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.510
What do you want

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.750
from me?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.510
Tonight's event

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.510
was set up for you by Zhou Tingyan.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.870
What else could I do?

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.120
I just want to ask you,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.870
can you please let me go?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.510
Please, no public apology.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.920
Let you go?

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.230
Is that my fault?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
Do you know

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.910
why I kept letting you off even if

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.440
you provoked me behind Yufeng's back?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.990
Why?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.270
Because

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.000
on this matter,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.000
the one I resent most is Yufeng.
