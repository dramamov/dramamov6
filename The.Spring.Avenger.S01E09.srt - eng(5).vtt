00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.240
Nian

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.090
Why are you doing this to me?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360
Why are you so angry?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.040
Didn't you always want to marry a rich man?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
Mr. Wang

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600
may be a bit older,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.200
but he's loaded.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.760
Gu Nian

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.240
I know all these years

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.640
you've never treated me like a human being.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.240
But even if I were a dog,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.120
After all these years of serving you,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120
doing so many things for you,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.840
even if I deserve no credit, I've put in the hard work.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.760
You can't just throw me away like that.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.640
Enough.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.760
Stop acting like you're dying

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.240
or some chaste martyr.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.800
Haven't you already gotten used to

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.360
being my stand-in?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.600
Who you sleep with

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.770
is just sleeping, isn't it?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.039
Alright.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.160
Go to my closet.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.039
All those designer clothes, bags, and jewelry,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.729
take whatever you want.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.640
Consider it

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.000
your payment.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.920
I'm going to take a shower first.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.920
Fangyue.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.800
What's wrong?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.320
Meng.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.039
I like you.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.840
I really like you so much.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.320
All these years,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.360
I've been by Guning's side,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.040
waiting on her hand and foot,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.840
enduring so much mistreatment.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.440
It was all so that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.040
I could be with you.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.720
Meng.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.360
You actually

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.440
like me a little bit too,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.840
don't you?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.640
No.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.920
If you feel tired of this,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.260
you can leave anytime.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.240
Gu Xiaomeng.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.520
You big fool.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.730
You'll end up dead at Gu Nian's hands sooner or later.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.240
Miss Jiang.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.730
What are you doing here?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.840
I'm here.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.840
You're here.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.040
Grandfather is getting impatient.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.000
Let's go in.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.920
Qiushan.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.360
So Miss Jiang

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.440
is actually

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.400
Qiushan's niece's tutor.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.120
What a coincidence.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.160
Grandfather.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.840
I hear Miss Jiang

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.040
is highly valued by the Mu family

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.440
and often stays overnight there.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.970
Someone who didn't know better

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.240
might think she was Qiushan's girlfriend.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.320
Well,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.320
I had a bit of conflict with Ms. Jiang last time.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.160
Mr. Mu was very protective of Ms. Jiang.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.000
They seem to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.100
have a good relationship.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.760
Mr. Mu is a good boss.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.500
He treats all employees well.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.240
So I'm very grateful.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.840
That's why I work harder

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.770
and stay late for overtime.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.120
What are you really up to?

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.960
Why don't you guess?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.840
Qiushan.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.240
Your marriage with Gu Nian

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.640
has been delayed for a long time,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.440
hasn't it?

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.040
I'm sorry.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.960
Miss Jiang.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.280
Grandpa Gu.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.170
Please just call me Chunyu.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.240
Chunyu.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.320
Chunyu.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.640
Thank you for saving my life last time.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.840
Come on.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.260
Let's all have a toast.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.159
Xiaomeng.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.800
You think I'm that stupid

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.800
to tamper with the drinks?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.040
Jiang Chunyu is determined

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.600
to sabotage this marriage.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.640
She wants Mu Qiushan

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.560
to be her protector.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.440
But she doesn't know this will offend the old man.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.640
The old man

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.320
values this marriage alliance greatly.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.960
He's ruthless and cruel.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.040
If he finds out

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.440
that she's seducing Mu Qiushan,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920
then

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.840
we won't need to intervene.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.800
She'll face serious consequences.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.580
Miss Jiang, what's wrong?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.170
Are you feeling unwell?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.040
It's nothing.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.360
I'm just feeling a bit dizzy.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.560
Had too much to drink?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.720
Someone come!

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.960
Help Miss Jiang

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.800
to the guest room to rest.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.560
Mr. Mu,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.200
Miss Jiang suddenly fainted.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.000
What?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.840
Qiushan is taking so long on the phone.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.360
Gu Nian,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.890
go check what's happening.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.700
Yes, Grandfather.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.720
Sir,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.960
I just saw Mr. Mu going to the guest room.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.960
Harder.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.240
Faster.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.520
Mr. Mu.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.440
That's it.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.520
Yes.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.640
Faster!

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.880
Chunyu!

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.760
What happened?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.040
Mr. Gu.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.040
When I came in just now,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.300
I found her passed out.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.240
Mr. Mu and I

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.850
were performing first aid.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.400
But to be safe,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.840
we should call an ambulance right away.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.360
Xiaomeng,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.360
you go.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.160
Miss Gu.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.860
You don't misunderstand about me and Mr. Mu, do you?

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.900
Where is everyone?

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.570
What's going on?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.920
Don't ask questions.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.530
Just cooperate with me.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.600
Soon,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.040
someone will come to enjoy the show.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.040
Sir,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.040
something terrible has happened!

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.640
Mr. Wang from Yingtian Construction is here.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.570
He says he wants to settle accounts with Miss Gu Nian.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.040
This is outrageous!

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.880
Again and again

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.210
you've made a fool of me.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.640
Do you think I'm made of paper?

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.440
Mr. Wang.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.200
Given our relationship,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.440
please speak freely.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.560
The Gu family will certainly give you an explanation.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.440
But if you're

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.000
deliberately causing trouble,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.600
don't blame me for being impolite.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.400
Before,

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.039
I was being unreasonable and that's fine.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:35.960
But today,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.600
Miss Gu clearly

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.919
invited me herself.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.900
And then she stood me up again.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.799
Isn't this deliberately making a fool of me?

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.240
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.700
When did I ever invite you?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720
You still deny it?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.360
Fine.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.160
Mr. Gu,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.600
see for yourself.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.040
Did she send this or not?

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.120
Come to room 1502 at Starlight Hotel immediately.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.720
Right now.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.080
Let me go!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.760
After what Gu Nian did to you,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.240
don't you want revenge?

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.200
Qiushan.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.360
Chunyu,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.200
I have some family matters to attend to.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.730
I won't keep you here today.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.680
Alright.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.040
We'll let you take care of it.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.240
Goodbye, Grandpa Gu.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.320
Mr. Mu,

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.040
I'll be going now.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.200
You use me and then want to leave.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.720
That's rather cold of you, Ms. Jiang.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.240
I haven't even had time to eat.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.300
Then let me treat you to a nice meal

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.560
to show my gratitude.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.000
Grandpa, I...

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.800
You disgraceful thing!

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.960
Grandpa,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.840
I really didn't do it.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840
You have to believe me.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.600
Shut up!

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.220
Haven't you caused enough trouble already?

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.680
Mr. Wang.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.000
It was our Gu family's fault today.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.200
We'll sign the contract as you requested.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.460
The Gu family will concede three points.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.560
Sir.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.400
Actually...

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.040
Get out!

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.360
Grandpa!

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.090
I'm begging you, please don't!

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.900
Don't touch my sister!

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.040
Hit me instead!

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.560
You think I wouldn't dare?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.920
Grandpa!

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.520
Grandpa!

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.320
No, please!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.640
Stop!

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.560
Don't!

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.200
I was really wrong, Grandpa.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.040
Please stop hitting.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.560
Please stop.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.640
Xiaomeng.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.000
Xiaomeng, are you okay?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.530
I'm fine.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.240
Is this

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.100
the feast you were talking about?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.240
Don't underestimate this bowl of noodles.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.800
The broth is made from beef bones

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.520
simmered for 12 hours.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.120
And with the owner's secret recipe,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.240
I think even Michelin restaurants can't compare.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.920
This is absolutely

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.570
the best noodles I've ever had.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.490
They are indeed delicious.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.040
But

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.240
how do you know so much about them?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.240
Because

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.600
this place holds my mother and my

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.060
most beautiful memories.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.920
Mom, eat more.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.320
Mom.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.620
I want to quit school and get a job.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.440
Nonsense.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.640
Chunyu.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.040
Don't worry.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.120
I'll do whatever it takes,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.720
to put you through college.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.000
Eat up.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.600
Ma'am,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.400
we only ordered one bowl.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:17.960
That's right.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.760
It's okay.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.240
This one's on me.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160
Thank you.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.560
You're welcome. Enjoy.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560
Thank you so much.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.360
Young lady,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.120
I just heard you're looking for a job.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.000
I'm short-handed here.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.640
If you don't mind the modest pay,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.000
you could help out here.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.400
Really?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.730
The pay doesn't matter.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.960
Thank you so much.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.640
Thank you.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.240
You're welcome.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.560
Go ahead and eat.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.440
Enjoy.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.720
Chunyu.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.100
Who is this gentleman?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.000
Auntie.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.000
This is Mr. Mu.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.400
He's my boss.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.120
How is Uncle Li doing?

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.240
Much better.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.520
Thanks to that reliable doctor you arranged.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.370
And you've been sending us money all these years.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.640
Otherwise I couldn't have kept this noodle shop running.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.440
Auntie.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.400
I'm just doing what I should.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.240
The kindness you showed to my mother and me,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.380
I will never forget it in my lifetime.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.400
Chunyu is truly a good child.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.040
Shuyun,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.760
unfortunately didn't have such blessing.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.440
Are you stupid?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.400
The old man just lost face.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.520
He'll just hit me a few times to vent.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.120
He won't hurt me badly.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.720
I can't watch you get beaten.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.360
Xiaomeng.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.600
Only you are good to me.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.640
If in this world,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.900
there was no Jiang Chunyu,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.720
how wonderful that would be.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.760
I really enjoyed this meal today.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.020
I had a wonderful time.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.640
It's been a while since I felt this relaxed.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.440
Thank you.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.920
If there's nothing else, Mr. Mu,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.980
I'll head back now.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.600
Wait.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.120
What is it, Mr. Mu?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.520
Do you have any other instructions?

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.320
Could you

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.020
stop calling me Mr. Mu?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.300
Just use my first name from now on.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.560
So, Mr. Mu, were you about to suggest

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.220
that since it's getting late,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.840
perhaps I should come up for a cup of tea?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.960
Good night.
