00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
Sorry,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.000
the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.700
Sorry,

Please try again later.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.940
Before this,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.660
I never dared to hope for anything.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.300
I love you.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.700
But today,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.820
I caught a glimpse of light.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.980
I want to hold onto it.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.260
We'll face

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.220
everything together.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.220
Yeah.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.500
(I thought I had caught the light.)

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.020
(But light can't be held.)

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.140
Uncle Zhou has found out the truth.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.050
Back then,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.140
it was Jian Wenqian

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.820
who told her cousin

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.730
to abduct Jian Cheng.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.540
What did you just say?

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.580
She's in the mountains.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.580
Can she not lose her dignity?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.260
Do you want people talking about you forever?

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.700
Son,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.900
think about it.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.820
Your grandpa cared about your dad.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.780
If it hadn't been for your uncle,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.380
Qianyi Group

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.860
would've belonged to your dad.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.020
And your dad's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.740
would've been yours.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.540
Jian Cheng saved

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.780
your uncle at this point.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.980
She just doesn't love you.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.900
Trust me on this.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.460
I've protected myself.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.580
Jian Cheng,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.220
I trust you.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.940
But I'm just not ready yet.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.540
(Turns out)

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.380
(when she needed me the most,)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.180
(I trusted others and gave up on her.)

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.300
Yawei...

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.540
Does she know about this?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.860
Of course.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.260
A few people ganged up on you.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.210
So you let go of Jian Cheng...

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.120
Stop talking.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.400
You lost Qianyi...

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.270
Stop talking!

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.500
It was bound to happen.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.260
Jiang Yawei.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.110
Your own personal hell

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.980
has arrived.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.820
If you want a better future,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.340
listen to Mom's advice:

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.460
Get a divorce.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.980
Before things turn ugly,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.180
ask for more money

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.700
and move to another city.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.020
Live your own life well.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.140
If you keep being stubborn,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.470
in the end,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.830
this mismatched marriage

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.240
will drain you into someone bitter.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.900
Eventually,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.700
you'll end up with nothing.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.140
Zhou Yufeng.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.380
Zhou Yufeng.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.060
Zhou Yufeng!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.580
Speak.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.780
Let's get divorced.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.830
Jiang Yawei,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.380
in this lifetime,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.180
I will never divorce you.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.220
Let go.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.820
Let me go.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.050
I wanted to apologize to Jian Cheng,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.700
but now I can't even face her.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.860
If it weren't for all that happened,

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.140
maybe we could've been friends.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.060
So...

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.780
you came to me,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.620
hoping I'd play peacemaker.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.140
Sorry.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.340
On this matter,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.700
I'm siding with Cheng.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.340
I heard

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.100
you're concerned
about Qin Zhuo and Mi Shan.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.980
What are you trying to say?

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.500
Five years ago,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.580
Mi Shan was drugged by her agent

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.460
and sent into Qin Zhuo's room.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.820
Qin Zhuo was too drunk,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.290
but he realized it and left.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.180
A Sasaeng fan still

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.500
snuck in and took photos.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.340
Next day, Mi Shan's scandalous photos
were everywhere.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.860
Out of guilt,

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.270
Qin Zhuo claimed to be her boyfriend

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.660
and explained about the photos.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.060
It also saved her career.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.020
So,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.420
the two of them

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.720
really had nothing going on.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.180
Mm-hmm.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.420
Then...

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.180
why are you telling me all this?

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.180
Because

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.450
you're someone important to Jian Cheng.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.490
If you're happy,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.780
Jian Cheng will be happy too.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.460
It's kind of

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.660
my way of making amends.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.580
I'm sorry.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.340
I want to speak for him

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.660
and apologize to you.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.940
Even his apology

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.660
has to come through you.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.060
There are some things

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.620
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.580
Don't say it.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.420
I feel like

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.700
maybe being friends

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.260
is better for us.
