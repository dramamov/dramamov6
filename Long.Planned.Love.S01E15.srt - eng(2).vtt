Bed rest for pregnancy?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.560
Because I'm just two months pregnant.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.400
The baby is unstable.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.070
I crashed into Jian Cheng's car,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.350
so I may have a miscarriage.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.350
Jian Cheng hit you first, right?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.310
If it hadn't been Jian Cheng,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.610
I wouldn't be here now.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.230
I'm sorry.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.400
The person you called
is busy making money.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.950
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.990
Jian Cheng.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.640
That was so cruel of you.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.310
You can't have kids yourself,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.280
so you went after Yufeng's child.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.790
Yufeng is right not to choose you.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.350
Cao Ying, what are you saying?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.070
You'd better hope
Jiang Yawei's baby is fine.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.950
- What?
- Or I won't let this slide.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.920
You've hurt my grandson.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.590
An innocent life.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.310
Even Zhou Tingyan can't shield you
this time.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.240
No, Cao Ying, you...

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.920
(Wow, throwing insults and running off.)

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.150
(How shameless can they be?)

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.510
(Wait a sec.)

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.870
No way, I can't go.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.710
Or I'll end up fighting
with Cao Ying.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.230
If I get hurt,
Zhou Tingyan will be upset.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.200
Hey.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.590
Honey.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.870
Someone's picking on me.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.150
It's fine, I'll stand up for you.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.360
Mm.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.620
Set up a family group chat.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.520
(Zhou Lu)
Invite all the Zhou family members

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.870
to the group chat.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.150
(Zhou Tingyan)
Got it, on it now.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.430
The audience is all here.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.240
(Zhou Tingyan)
This is the security footage.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.150
Post it in the group.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.000
No need to hold back.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.030
Say whatever you want.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.150
I've got your back.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.830
Impressive.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.960
Baichuan, you need to step in and stop this.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.800
A child unraised is the parent's fault.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.080
(Zhou Family)
A wife's failing is the husband's fault.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.870
This is on me. I'm sorry.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.280
I'll come by to apologize in person.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.960
Your mom would never admit she's wrong.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.800
Just apologize on your mom's behalf.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.510
And send Jian Cheng a few red packets.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.180
You and your wife owe an apology too.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.590
Dad, if we apologize,
we'll lose dignity.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.370
I've posted an apology in the group.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.400
Not apologizing is a slap in my face.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.590
Uncle Zhou crossed the line.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.390
You've always treated him well.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.150
Yet he dragged you into the mess.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.270
What a fool.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.340
Only if I step in will this mess end.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.560
Uncle Zhou is doing this to save my face.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.710
He's giving you an exit.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.270
Nice.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.860
(Zhou Family)

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.640
(Tingyan is actually defending Jian Cheng.)

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.000
You're such bad luck.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.590
Ever since you married in,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.030
we haven't had a single good day.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.200
Yufeng's job was taken

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.000
by Zhou Lu because of you.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.590
You made me look bad in front of
those wealthy madams.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.400
Even Yufeng's dad got embarrassed.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.030
You only bring trouble.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.630
You're a walking disaster.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.310
Mom.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.390
Yawei's still pregnant.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.430
I didn't lie.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.030
If it weren't for Jian Cheng,
I wouldn't be like this.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.870
You... just wait and see.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.710
Mom, please step outside first.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.430
Zhou Lu...

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.430
Zhou Lu, what do you mean?

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.590
You just do whatever Uncle Zhou says.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.710
Unbelievable.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.660
Do we have that many people in our family?

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.180
What, they're popping out of coffins?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.680
Oh, there are plenty.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.040
Your mom's aunts, uncles,
and your granduncle.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.670
The list keeps going.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.920
Uncle Zhou is in the group.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.750
Perfect chance to make some connections.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.920
I'm even thinking of bringing in

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.980
the single nephew of my aunt's son-in-law.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.720
Lots of single ladies in the group.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.210
We could just set them up.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.560
If you can't handle it, leave the group.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.230
But let me warn you.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.900
Uncle Zhou actually tagged you all.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.910
Better apologize before you leave.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.560
Do like I did.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.560
Send a message.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.600
Just a "sorry" will do.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.710
No need to say more.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.920
I didn't say Jian Cheng was involved.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.830
It was your mom who misunderstood.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.830
Clearly, she wanted
to target Jian Cheng.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.000
And she even hit me.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.950
Why should I apologize?

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.310
My dad already apologized.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.690
Not apologizing is disrespecting him.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.750
You're saving face for my dad.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.310
I'm fed up with this.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.370
Stop stirring up trouble.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.450
I'll get you some med.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.540
(Zhou Family)

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.620
On behalf of my mom, I apologize to you.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.000
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.780
(Zhou Family)

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.120
That video really was shocking.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.510
Yufeng, lay off driving.
You're risking others.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.510
Mrs. Zhou, how could you not let us know?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.120
Something this big happened.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.920
(Best Wishes)
I didn't even visit you.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.000
That's really a shame.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.270
I sent you a red envelope.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.310
Get something to recover.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.510
(Honey)
Keep this group.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.180
(Zhou Tingyan)
Add anyone

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.890
(Best Wishes)
bothers you in.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.070
Let them lose face.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.710
(Zhou Tingyan)
Generous, honey.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.720
This group will be my Judgment Court.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.720
I'll spend a little
to keep it running well.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.580
(Generous, honey.)

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.270
You had Zhou Lu make the group
to back her up?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.750
That's right.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.510
It's fine if you want to help her out.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.590
Just make a group

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.190
and only invite people in Jiangyu.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.040
Why drag in all those

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.880
messy connections?

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.160
You can't ignore our family's reputation

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.150
just for something this minor.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.630
That road only had her car at the time.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.830
You should be glad
there were no other cars.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.160
If Yufeng had gone through
with that move,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.530
what would the outcome've been?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.120
Just picturing it in makes me...

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.920
She's endured so much.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.560
So what if she lost her temper?

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.270
But why make it a public spectacle?

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.270
Family troubles should stay
within the family.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.510
Cao Ying cares most about dignity.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.750
I intend to strip her of that.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.430
She bullied Cheng before we married

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.070
and still dared to after our marriage.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.750
I want everyone to know,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.950
Jian Cheng is not someone
they can mess with.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.050
Before they try to mess with her,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.950
they should ask me if I'll allow it.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.390
Zhou Baichuan,
you've never stood up for me.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.750
The only time you showed guts

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.270
is when you fought Dad over Guan Ling.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.830
Why are you bringing her up?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.630
What did she even do wrong?

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.510
I just can't stand her.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.190
Why does she get everything

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.190
without lifting a finger?

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.590
And now,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.630
her son married the woman
my son didn't want.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.480
Finally, I feel vindicated.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.750
Zhou Tingyan married Jian Cheng just to

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.750
get back at Master Zhou
for ruining his mother's life.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.600
Jian Cheng, that fool,

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.680
still thinks Zhou Tingyan loves her.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.310
She's nothing more than a pawn.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.040
I'm just waiting to see her fall.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.710
(So,)

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.950
(Uncle Zhou married Jian Cheng just to
spite Grandpa.)

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.100
(Not out of affection.)

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.750
(It was all revenge.)

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.930
(Nephew)
Want to know why he married you?

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.430
Tomorrow, 9 am.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.830
Meet at the cafe
at the end of East St.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.200
Cheng, Cheng.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.080
Tang.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.860
You really shouldn't go.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.150
Zhou Yufeng is salty

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.840
about you calling him out in the group.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.630
He's holding a grudge.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.440
Forget why Zhou Tingyan married you.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.630
He's honestly been so good to you.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.390
He's let you have your way.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.510
Look, he even made a big scene today

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.030
just to stand up for you.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.920
Right?

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.870
Pull yourself together.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.270
Honestly, whatever the reason
he married me,

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.510
I can live with it.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.480
So, are you still going or not?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.320
Screenshot.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.300
(Honey)

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.980
(Nephew: Want to know
why he married you?)

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.700
(Meet me at the cafe at the end of East St.)

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.360
Meeting my ex-fiance alone is a big deal.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.120
I should tell Zhou Tingyan first.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.120
Or he'll get mad once he finds out.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.850
And he'll keep me up all night again.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.870
Which means stress for nothing.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.990
Tang.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.030
You said I've got Zhou Tingyan hooked.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.270
That's not true.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.390
Remember what I told you before?

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.430
About that big client of Qianyi Group.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.390
Zhou Tingyan treats me really well now,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.480
but I still feel so much pressure.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.110
Cheng.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.270
That Qianyi big client you mentioned

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.360
sounds like someone I know.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.750
Who?

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.480
Kind of like one of Qin Zhuo's cousins.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.630
Her name's Qin Yingzhi.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.150
Wouldn't it be even riskier if it's her?

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.030
Stop overthinking.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.030
If it were Qin Yingzhi, that'd be fine.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.510
To Zhou Tingyan, she's like Qin Zhuo.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.740
Just family, nothing more.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.390
But she made Zhou Lu suspicious.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.150
This is exhausting.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.870
(Is Zhou Lu misleading Cheng?)

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.150
(Why hasn't Zhou Tingyan replied yet?)

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.150
(He usually answers right away.)

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.750
Hey, Cheng.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.190
I'm meeting Zhou Lu, see you.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.350
Jian Cheng.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.710
Yeah?

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.630
There's something you should know.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.630
When my mom was in college,
she went back to her high school

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.550
and met Zhou Baichuan.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.870
He fell for her instantly.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.150
My mom told him

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.670
she'd think about it.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.360
But later, during a charity event,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.630
she met Master Zhou.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.390
After that, a lot happened.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.100
My mother was forced
to marry Master Zhou.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.270
Zhou Baichuan only found out at the wedding

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.630
that the bride was my mother.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.730
They had a serious fallout.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.150
My mother lived in deep misery.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.150
Master Zhou locked away
all her youth and freedom.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.670
What Zhou Yufeng means is

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.750
his father took the woman
my father loved.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.000
He thought I'd seek revenge

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.750
and take his wife.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.350
Zhou Tingyan.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.030
I know.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.360
It's not revenge.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.350
(Zhou Tingyan,)

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.240
(let's heal)

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.480
(all our wounds.)

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.240
Jian Cheng, that fool,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.360
still thinks Zhou Tingyan loves her.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.790
She's nothing more than a pawn.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.550
I'm just waiting to see her fall.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.890
What did that "one" you sent me mean?

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.870
"One" means

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.650
you made me mad, so you lost a point.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.200
From now on, every time you annoy me,

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.090
you lose one point.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.870
When you've lost a full hundred,

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.430
I'll no longer love you.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.650
(After leaving me,)

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.030
(life hasn't been great for you either.)

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.750
I told her about Master Zhou
forcing the marriage.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.730
(Jian Cheng)
Enjoy your coffee.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.270
Don't play these tricks again.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.330
If you still call yourself a man,

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.480
come to me directly.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.120
I'm Zhou Tingyan.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.790
(With this child,)

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.870
(I can find my place in the Zhou Family.)

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.150
(I've worked so hard for this.)

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.850
(Finally, I've reached this point.)

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.150
(Nothing can go wrong with this baby.)

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.110
Mom.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.710
Drink up.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.390
What is this?

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.390
It's a secret formula for having a son.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.510
It's very effective.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120
Drink it while it's hot.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.750
It's half as effective when it cools.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.150
Mom, the doctor said,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.630
those folk remedies are all scams.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.870
Blindly taking medicine is harmful.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.510
Besides, I'm already hospitalized.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.480
Let's listen to the doctor.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.750
Just drink it.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.790
You're carrying my grandson.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.510
Would I hurt you?

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.630
If it weren't for my grandson,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.390
you think I'd be waiting on you?

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.350
Drink.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.150
Just drink when I tell you to.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.750
That's more like it.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.680
- Mom.
- Yeah.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.470
Yawei.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.370
Why do you look so pale?

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.000
Mom, what's wrong with Yawei?

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.600
Morning sickness.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.750
All women go through it.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.510
No need to make a fuss.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.220
(The next day)

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.130
Yawei.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.460
Mom said your morning sickness is bad.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.150
I've noticed you've lost lots of weight.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.870
My mom said,

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.880
she'll take care of your meals.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.590
That way,

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.960
I can rest easy.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.270
It's only been two months.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.640
How bad can the sickness be?

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.030
I ended up like this

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.940
because of your mom's secret recipe.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.630
Yufeng,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.510
can you tell your mom

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.360
to stop making me drink that stuff?

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.610
Every time I drink it, I throw up.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.750
And my stomach hurts.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.150
If this goes on,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.510
I'm afraid I might really…

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.480
Yawei, just listen to her.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.480
She's doing it for the sake of our baby.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.750
No matter how much she dislikes you,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.880
she'd never do anything
to harm the child.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.270
Besides, this is a good chance

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.640
to improve things between you.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.920
You can't keep giving the cold shoulder.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.960
Come on, be good.
