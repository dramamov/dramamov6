00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.210
Captain Ma.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.250
How's it going over there?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.960
She keeps looking at the clock.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.080
She must be up to something,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.010
but I can't figure it out right now.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.600
Xu Qingli said

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.290
back then,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.580
he saw with his own eyes

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.490
the entire process of Cao Xiaojun

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.910
and Wu Ximei burying Ni Xiangdong's body.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.510
Ni Xiangdong's body

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.360
had multiple stab wounds

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.220
in the abdomen,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.840
and his face was smashed.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.710
So we need to focus on finding out

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.300
the specific state

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.920
of Ni Xiangdong's death

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.670
and the exact burial site.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.480
Okay.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.910

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.390
Yes.

[January 4, 2011]

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.720
Since you already know everything,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.600
just sentence me as you see fit.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.620
Why bother interrogating me?

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.910
Having you confess

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.670
is giving you a chance

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.910
for leniency.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.480
Fine, I'll talk.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.270
Can you promise

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.710
that you won't tell Tianbao about this?

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.320
Yes.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.390
At that time,

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.740
Ni Xiangdong was already addicted
to drugs.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.200
He often didn't come home,

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.600
and his moods were unpredictable.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.270
One night he came home

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.119
and suddenly went crazy,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.339
saying he wanted to find his gun
to settle a score with someone.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.470
Where's my five-shooter?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.060
I tried to stop him.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.579
When I tried to stop him, he...

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.109
pinned me down on the bed

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.440
and started choking me.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.490
I'll kill you!

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.250
Xiaojun came over to stop him.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.850
He stabbed him once in the back.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.830
Ni Xiangdong...

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.830
kicked Xiaojun away

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.010
and continued choking me.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.690
I was choked unconscious.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.750
When I regained consciousness,

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.560
I saw Xiaojun and Ni Xiangdong

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.680
lying on the floor.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.640
I went to check on them

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.480
and found Ni Xiangdong was already dead.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.170
Are you sure he was dead at the time?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.860
His stomach was covered in blood.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.370
Other than the wounds...

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.790
on his stomach and back,

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.670
were there wounds anywhere else?

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.030
No.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.350
None at all?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:19.750
No.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.930
Alone,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.690
I couldn't handle both of them.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.310
So I thought of a way

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.640
to separate them.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.010
Whoever
went to the Chengxi construction site,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.640
it would buy me some time.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.050
I just wanted to talk to either of them,

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.030
whether it was Cao Xiaojun

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:39.880
or Wu Ximei.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.240
Either one would do.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.480
I just wanted

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.000
to have a proper talk with them.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.120
I told him,

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.920
"I didn't do anything.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.460
Why do you want to kill me?"

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.800
Then he suddenly got agitated.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.330
He stabbed me with a knife.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.330
I could only fight back.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.200
Then I grabbed a rock

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.270
in self-defense.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.110
It's not up to you to decide

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.350
if it was self-defense or not.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.630
We determine that.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.070
But I hope you

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.340
don't lie to us.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.070

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.110

on the construction site's scaffold

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.270
put there by you?

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.880
Did you tamper

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.070
with that scaffold?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.270
So whether it was Wu Ximei

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.880
or Cao Xiaojun,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.610

I didn't tamper with anything.

That construction site

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.040
has been abandoned for many years.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.940
Nobody has maintained it.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.270
fell?

You're too worked up right now.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.110
Go wash your face

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.790
and calm down!

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.190
Why do I need to calm down?

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.200
A few words

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.350
have gotten you this agitated.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.510
Can you still conduct an interrogation?

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.790

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.350
Is that it?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.340
was an accident or not

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.270

It was Xu Qingli!

Xu Qingli went there beforehand

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.240

You gambled
that even if the police searched,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.480
they might eventually give up

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.360

the rocks too numerous.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.650

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.280
You can keep saying you don't know.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.280
You can say you're not sure.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.440
Or you can

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.640
continue to remain silent

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.590
as you are now.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.790
But

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.550
it will only affect yourself.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.160
The name Xu Qingli—

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.810
you should know it, right?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.550
So his name is Xu Qingli.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.690
Now we have found

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.380
the real Ni Xiangdong's body.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.380
Having you confess now

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.550
is giving you a chance

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.880
for leniency.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.000
Tell us,

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.650
how did the real Ni Xiangdong die?

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.200
If

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.130
the one who died wasn't Ni Xiangdong,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.800
it would be me and Cao Xiaojun.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.410
Why do you say that?

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.930
Because Ni Xiangdong
killed someone at the time.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.540
He killed someone?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.790
Who did he kill?

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:34.640
Bao Desheng.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200
One night,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.730
he came back from outside,

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.750
carrying a black leather bag.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.310
His clothes were covered in blood.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.690
Then Xiaojun checked

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.240
that leather bag.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.560
There was a lot of money inside.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.790
And the Bao family's gift receipt list.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.200
Xu Qingli.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.640
How was your relationship

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.640
with Cao Xiaojun?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.550
We used to be friends.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.470
Did he ever talk to you

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.550
about his past?

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.150
He never mentioned to you

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.140
he and Ni Xiangdong were sworn brothers,
did he?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.020
They'd been gang members since childhood,

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.420
causing a lot of trouble.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:28.410
But later,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.070
Cao Xiaojun turned over a new leaf,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.870
while Ni Xiangdong sank deeper,

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.310
ending up with a life on his hands.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.770
There was no turning back.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.680
Ni Xiangdong killed someone?

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.310
You've lived under Ni Xiangdong's name

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.830
for all these years.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.080
Don't you know anything about him?

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:49.880
If

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.680
the Liu Cheng'an case hadn't happened,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.200
once you were caught,

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.000
all of Ni Xiangdong's sins

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.720
would be

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:58.960
pinned on you.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:33:59.880
When that happens,

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.830
would you be Ni Xiangdong

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.030
or Xu Qingli?

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.000
I would definitely be Xu Qingli.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.840
I am Xu Qingli.
