WEBVTT

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.920
Why didn't you use the door?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.760
Climbing through windows is dangerous.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.560
If we're putting on an act, we should go all the way.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.560
So we don't waste

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.080
Mr. Mu's good intentions.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.519
But tell me,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.650
did they believe it?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.039
You said

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.960
it was an award-winning performance.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.490
They must have believed it.

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.840
Tell me.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.770
What exactly happened?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.610
It was all arranged by Gu Xiaomeng.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.600
He must have found out

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.280
that I'm investigating the truth about that accident.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.880
Guilty conscience, I guess.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.000
I figured as much.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.560
That's why I'm pretending to be paralyzed,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.220
to make them lower their guard

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.440
while I search for evidence.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.400
But it's been so many years.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.680
It might be difficult to find anything.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.080
The Gu siblings have always been arrogant.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.000
They wouldn't have covered their tracks completely.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.060
There must be some clues left behind.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.160
I believe

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.920
the spirits of my brother and sister-in-law

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.250
will surely protect me.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.240
So you've learned to use your charm now.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.320
Yes.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.120
After all my sacrifices,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.400
how do you plan to make it up to me?

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.960
Sis.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.500
Are you really bringing Mu Qiushan over?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.840
What's wrong?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.840
Are you upset?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.040
No,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.440
I just think there's more to him.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360
His leg injury might be fake.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.300
It's precisely because he's not that simple

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.560
that we need to keep him where we can watch him.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.200
That's a good idea.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.560
Find a way to get

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.290
the patent as soon as possible.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.440
After you arrive at the Gu family,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.570
you must be careful.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.320
Gu Nian isn't stupid,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.880
she won't be easy to deal with.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.720
Don't worry.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.920
If you don't enter the tiger's den,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.000
how can you catch the cubs?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.280
At least you're still working behind the scenes.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.360
We'll coordinate from inside and outside,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360
and stay in touch.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720
I'm leaving then.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.800
Be careful.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.410
This is really nice.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.410
Thank you for your trouble.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.170
No need to be polite.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.320
We'll be family soon.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.079
Xiaomeng,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400
hurry up and pour tea for your brother-in-law.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.720
Qiushan,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.680
are you okay?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.000
Are you hurt?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.320
It's fine.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.520
Luckily they're just useless legs.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.320
Xiaomeng,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.920
what's wrong with you?

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.320
You can't even pour water properly.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.240
Apologize to your brother-in-law right now.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.040
Ever since Mu Qiushan came to the Gu family,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.079
my sister has been giving me the cold shoulder

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.519
and treating me with contempt.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.760
You can't stand the sight of me, right?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.560
I'm leaving.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.920
You.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.800
Qiushan.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.580
Don't be angry with Xiaomeng.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.560
He just has a strange temper.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.200
I'll go talk to him.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.520
Okay.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.020
It seems Mu Qiushan's legs

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.610
are truly crippled.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.040
His legs are ruined.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.680
My heart isn't dead yet.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.840
How dare you lie to me.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.600
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.280
What are you planning to do, sis?

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.480
Isn't Mu Qiushan investigating the sports car incident?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.800
He'll never find any evidence.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.920
At this moment

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.240
we can take the opportunity.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.440
Oh no.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.840
Oh no, sis.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.240
Mu Qiushan seems to have discovered

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.440
that the car was mine.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.120
This is all your fault.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.240
Go after him now!

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.580
When you catch him,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.159
break his legs.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.520
We've already bought the wheelchair,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.000
might as well put it to use.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.960
Get in the car.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.080
Hurry!

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.120
Stop!

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.440
Stop right there!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.120
Nian.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.760
Xiaomeng is so capable,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.760
he'll definitely catch Mu Qiushan.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.920
Don't be angry.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.800
Even if we don't catch him,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.120
I have other ways.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.480
I'm sorry.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.680
He got away.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.960
It's okay.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.880
Fang Yue has

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.320
already found where the patent documents are hidden.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.520
While Mu Qiushan

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.840
and Jiang Chunyu are still figuring things out,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.960
let's go get those documents back first.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.880
Get them back.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Of course.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.240
Why do you think the old man

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.400
is so obsessed with this marriage alliance?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.920
It's not just because the Mu family has patents,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920
but also because

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.680
they have a mature R&D team.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.440
And a tech production line.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.640
But

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.120
having patents alone

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280
is useless.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.800
Of course it's useful.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.930
Once we have the patent documents,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.720
we can set up our own R&D and production team,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.880
and it'll work just the same.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.280
What do you think those old guys on the board

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.200
really want?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.120
Isn't this exactly what they're after?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.920
Meng,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.800
thank you for your hard work today.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.880
As for this matter,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.540
I'll handle it myself.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.760
Meng.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.890
Where are you going?

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.890
Of course he's stealing the patent documents for me.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:49.040
Otherwise, for something so dangerous,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.960
would he let me go?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.020
Even if Mu Qiushan isn't home,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.620
there should still be a housekeeper.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.040
Why is it so quiet?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.160
A trap.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.460
I only have one chance.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.220
Whether it's a trap or not,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.200
I must get that patent.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.000
Your trick of drawing the snake out of its hole

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.120
really works well.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.520
Luring Gu Nian to steal patents from the Mu family.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.330
She won't fall for it, will she?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.860
Even a cornered dog will leap over a wall.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.280
She's left with nothing now.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.400
If there's even a 1% chance,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.880
she'll take it.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.760
Cut the crap.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.530
If you've got the guts, take me to the police station.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.560
Taking you to the police station

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.420
would be letting you off too easy.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.520
Ten years ago,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.920
when you were driving that modified sports car,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.080
did you hit someone?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320
Don't worry.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.120
Jiang Chunyu won't get away.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.560
Brother.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.560
Brother.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.200
Brother.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.680
Brother.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.520
Yes, I have.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.880
I've bumped into many people.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.440
Which one are you talking about?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.880
Let me see if I remember.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.440
You beast!

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.320
Qiushan!

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.760
Hit me!

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.730
Beat me to death!

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.400
Will that bring your brother and sister-in-law back to life?
