00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.890
If I win, you'll get half the money.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.670
Draw.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.550
Hold your horses.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.000
I win.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.980
Single wait on the Red Dragon.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.870
Impressive.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.120
"Mixed Flush," six Fan;

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.030
"Bottom of the River,” eight Fan.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.270
"Single Waiting" adds one more Fan.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:41.840
4,900.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.870
Such bad luck.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.120
Pay up.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.080
It's okay.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.840
Wins and losses happen.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.510
Next round

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.150
I'll be the dealer. I'll make you

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.150
lose everything.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.820
-Okay. I'm waiting for you.
-Lose everything.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.360
Nice draw, Ying.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.530
Thank you, Brother.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.369
Mr. Liang?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.510
You're all here, huh?

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.270
Mr. Liang.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.160
Excuse me.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.250
I need to speak to Xiangdong
about something.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.750
I'll have my brother

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.790
play a few rounds for him.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.109
Sure, no problem.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:13.440
Xiangdong.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.109
Come on.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.960
Come over here.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.880
Let's keep going.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.790
You guys keep playing.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.109
Okay.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:17.720
Come on.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.440
Come on.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.480
I'll be back.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.160
Alright. We'll be waiting for you.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.589
Come on.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.589
Let's continue.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.120
It's from abroad.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.030
How is it?

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.970
Too strong.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.080
I can't get used to it.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.590
Leave us for a moment.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.270
Okay.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.810
How about this one?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.750
This should be more to your taste.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.240
It's from abroad.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.720
In all of Jialin,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.700
I'm the only one who has it.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.270
Try it.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:57.400
How is it?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.440
Not bad.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.270
You're one lucky bastard.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.430
Who would've thought this Xu
would come into the picture?

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.700
He didn't just help me.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.880
He helped you too.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:18.640
Xiangdong,

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.910
your days of being pushed around

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.070
are over.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.240
You can't

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.830
keep doing petty business

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.070
in that little pond

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.880
on Huayuan Street.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.560
You're meant to ride the waves.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.470
You need to go out to sea
and face the storms.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.870
Out there,
the big fish and prawns are everywhere.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.160
You just have to reach out and grab them.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680
How do I grab them?

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.960
I'll leave this

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.400
to you.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.510
One trip a week.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.110
Are you in?

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.070
I'm in!

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.240
Good!

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.000
I knew I wasn't wrong about you.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.640
Your hands bring good fortune too.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.900
Your hands are so soft.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.890
That's not what you said earlier.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.090
You said my hands bring bad luck.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.140
Let me smell them then.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.400
[No littering]

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.460
They smell so good.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.390
Does your body smell even better?

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.750
[No littering]

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.310
You're so naughty.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.420
You've been waiting here the whole time?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.730
She told you to keep an eye on me?

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.830
I need to talk to you about something.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.600
Wait for me up ahead.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:20.920
I'm listening.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.880
Are we still brothers?

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.790
Women can come and go,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.100
but brothers are for life.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.240
I've always listened to you.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.270
So please listen to me today.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.750
We're not young anymore.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.590
We've had our fun.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.420
It's time to find something decent to do.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.060
You may not think of yourself,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.830
but you must at least think of Ximei.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.000
Let's go home.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.440
People like us are like ships,

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.310
born to drift.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.640
If we drop anchor in one place,

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.160
enduring wind, sun, and rain every day,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.000
we'll be battered to pieces

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.480
before we even set sail.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.750
You really want that?

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.590
Do you still have feelings for Ximei?

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.310
What difference does it make?

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:52.930
Xiangdong.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.040
Liang Da.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.280
This is my brother, Xiaojun.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.350
Hello.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.720
Call him Boss.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.410
It's good to have a brother.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.550
Next time,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.570
bring him along.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.320
Let's make money together.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.070
What's with that long face?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.970
What? You're

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.600
in cahoots with Liang Da now?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.690
In cahoots?

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.720
That's disgusting.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.830
He's introducing us to some business.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.920
Business? What kind of business?

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.550
Business?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.640
You know what kind of person Liang Da is.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.680
You're the one who told us

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.740
not to touch drugs.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.590
This is the rule you set for us.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.360
I didn't touch drugs.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.210
Look at yourself now.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.550
You think anyone would believe that?

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.880
Do you even believe it yourself?

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.280
I'm just having some fun.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.640
I'm not addicted.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.830
Touch that stuff once, and you're dead.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.790
It'll ruin the rest of your life.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.510
My life has long been ruined.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.560
Hasn't yours too?

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.560
Cao Xiaojun,

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.590
you think we still have

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.830
a bright future ahead?

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.720
From the day we were born,

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.810
we were thrown onto this rotten road.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.720
Honest work?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.540
What honest work can you even do?

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.220
How many times have you been in jail?

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.350
How many criminal records do you have?

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.050
Turning over a new leaf?

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.750
It's impossible.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.060
Taking the right path isn't easy,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.400
but it's still better than

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.600
digging your own grave like you are now.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.440
I'll end up executed

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.970
or hacked to death anyway.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.720
So what?

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.840
Dong, that won't happen.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.510
My life is already ruined.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.440
I might as well ruin it completely.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.920
Ni Xiangdong, I'm begging you!

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.640
If I'm lucky,

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.530
maybe I can make something
out of my ruined life.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.360
Let's go.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.590
[Sweet Barbershop]

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.360
[Wash, cut, and blow-dry]
[Haircut] [Shave]

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:28.880
Dong.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.110
Where have you been lately?

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.770
I couldn't find you anywhere.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.810
What are you looking for?

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.900
Where's my five-shooter?

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.320
Stop looking.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:57.900
You took it?

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.690
Give it to me.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.440
Give it to me.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.740
This isn't something for you to take.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.590
We need to talk things out today.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.890
Talk about what?

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.080
About the road ahead.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.350
About our future.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.350
Fine. Let's talk.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.210
Let's talk.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.560
I don't know

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.990
how we ended up like this.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.570
We've been together for 4 years.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.280
How many 4 years
does a person get in their life?

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.440
What do you mean?

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.750
You don't want to be with me anymore?

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.050
I'm saying this precisely because

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:45.850
I want to make a good life with you.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.350
What's wrong with me making money outside?

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.000
What kind of money are you making?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.880
I want to live

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.200
a steady, honest life with you.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.310
I can't live

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.920
that kind of "steady" life.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.100
How about that?

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.510
I'm doing this for your own good—

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.440
for our good.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.400
This is our third child.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.510
I knew the timing

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.240
wasn't right for the first one.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.310
For the second,

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.920
we agreed to keep it.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.640
But in the end?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.680
It was all because of you!

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.830
Now it's our third child.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.590
I must keep this baby.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.680
Keep it for what?

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.680
So this kid
can end up washing hair like you?

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.920
Or be a thug like me?

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.350
We were born cursed.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.200
Dong.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.510
Dong.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.200
Move.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.480
Ximei can't

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.880
have another abortion.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:52.920
The doctor said

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.450
it might be her last chance.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.630
You two go get your marriage certificate.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.770
I'll

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.440
raise the child.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.920
No wonder all these years

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.250
you never found a woman.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.410
You like my woman, don't you?

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.060
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.570
This bastard is his, isn't it?

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.370
Ni Xiangdong!

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.920
Have you forgotten

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.270
where she came from?

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.680
Kapok Lane!

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.230
We were all just customers there!

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.920
Come on!

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.390
Come on! Join us!

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.110
Ni Xiangdong!

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.070
-Are you crazy?
-Come on! Come on!

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.320
Come on!

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.310
Go to hell!

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.110
You dare hit me?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.720
You two adulterers!

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.680
Ni Xiangdong!

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.440
Have you lost your mind?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.470
Stop fighting!

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.520
-How dare you hit me!
-Stop!

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.580
Are you insane?

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.580
I don't want the child!

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.630
I'll kill you!

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.640
I'll kill you, then kill him!

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.920
Ni Xiang...

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.590
I don't want the child!

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.100
I've got blood on my hands before!

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.110
I'll be executed sooner or later.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.300
Xiaojun!

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:27.510
Xiaojun!

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.780
Cao Xiaojun, stop pushing forward.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.710
Always pushing and pushing.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.550
Disgusting!

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.170
Why don't you look behind you?

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.000
Xiaojun.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:05.960
Xiaojun.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.230
I'm terrified.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.960
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.760
People are scarier than ghosts.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.190
Xiaojun, let's get this done quickly.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.520
Let's go once it's done.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.400
Hurry up.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.630
Let's go.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:27.710
Let's go.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.550
Dong.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:50.880
Dong.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.190
Xiaojun.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.930
You had a nightmare?

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.120
Why did you have a nightmare again?

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.550
I...

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.440
killed Dong twice.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.920
Both times I did it myself.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.480
You still don't get it?

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.760
That Ni Xiangdong

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.000
is just a name.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.710
We don't even know

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.000
what his

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:38.880
real name is.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.080
Ni Xiangdong was nice to you.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.180
But then?

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.960
He changed.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.250
How can you be sure

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.920
this man won't change?

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.390
You did it for Tianbao

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:01.550
and for our family.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.440
Take care of Tianbao.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.490
I'm going to find the boat boss.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.710
Eat some noodles before you go.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.110
They're already cooked.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.000
I've told the landlord

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.840
and taken care of the barber shop.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.250
Didn't we agree to leave together?

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.480
Why aren't you packing?

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.430
You should go.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.090
This has nothing to do with you.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.960
Cao Xiaojun.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:46.610
Let's go together.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.230
I killed Dong.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.080
I'm not a good person either.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.760
Being with me

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.520
will only bring you trouble.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.190
If he hadn't died,

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.490
none of us would have survived.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.150
We did it to save ourselves.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.000
We only killed a bad man.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.810
Do we still deserve punishment for that?

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.070
Xiaojun,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.260
let's leave together.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.550
We still have a long life ahead of us.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.890
Being together,
we can look after each other.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:08.710
Do me a favor.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.110
Say it.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:18.960
All these years,

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.710
I've always wanted you

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.190
to cut my hair once.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.820
But I never had the courage to ask.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.480
Okay.
