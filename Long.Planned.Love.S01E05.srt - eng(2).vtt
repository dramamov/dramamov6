00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.040
Four characters.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.230
Pung.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.940
Mom, you guys take your time.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.360
I need to deal with some work stuff.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.700
Go ahead.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.540
Mrs. Jian,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.460
I heard that on Wenqian's birthday,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.260
the girl Yufeng was protecting

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.140
was his secretary and lover.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270
He broke off the engagement
because of her.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.460
Nonsense!

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.580
Guess you haven't heard yet.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.420
Jian Cheng pushed her down the stairs.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.220
What?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.060
Where did you even hear that?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560
Well, you can't exactly blame
Jian Cheng.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.800
That woman

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.900
knowingly become a mistress.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.060
Don't you think?

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.700
But Jian Cheng made such a scene.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.900
Who could put up

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.180
with her temper in the future?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.500
Enough.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.540
Keep it down.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.770
Come on, let's keep playing.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.980
Whose turn is it? Hurry up.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.900
(That girl is embarrassing me
outside again.)

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.460
Enough! I'm done.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.620
Sorry.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.040
The person you're calling

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.260
is busy making money.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.780
You just can't go a day

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.140
without causing trouble, can you?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.820
She... Give her a call.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.300
Sorry.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.500
The person you're calling...

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.780
Hello?

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.460
What did I tell you before?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Men are all like this.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.290
When he values his mistress,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.940
you must not hurt her.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.300
Until Zhou Yufeng

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.860
loses his spark

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.300
for that girl,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.580
that would be fine.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.660
But you pushed her down the stairs.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.580
Were you even thinking?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.100
Yufeng is clearly siding with her now.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.550
Why are you picking a fight head‑on?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.580
What matters now is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.940
that you successfully marry

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.100
into the Zhou Family.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.380
Jian Cheng.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.380
Jian Cheng.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.720
I just assumed after-effects
of your concussion

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.730
made you act up like this.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.100
But you'd better know when to stop.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.020
It's you who broke off the engagement.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.020
So from now on,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.900
you'd better keep yourself in check.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Sorry.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.460
Seems I forgot something today.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.860
Forgot what?

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.390
Forgot I already spared you
some dignity.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.660
You actually dared to hit me.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.140
Zhou Yufeng.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.420
Do I need to remind you
of the family rules?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.620
Uncle, you're really planning

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.220
to steal my fiancée, huh?

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.500
You could just

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.260
jump down from here.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.540
It's high enough

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.240
to make you look passionate.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.220
So about registering the marriage,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.020
does it still count?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.300
As long as you've decided,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.260
it counts.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.260
Yeah.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.660
Then tomorrow morning I...

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.680
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.140
Yeah.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.860
Register the marriage?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.700
Yeah.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.940
That's fast.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.380
Zhou Tingyan has helped you
so many times

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.700
because you saved his life.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.100
That shows he's someone
who values loyalty

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.460
and keeps his word.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.500
People like that

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.820
are usually very responsible.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.620
You should try to make him
fall for you,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.920
and turn this act into reality.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.780
He'll spoil you endlessly.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.460
Fall for me?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.180
Cheng, although

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.880
the purpose of getting married
is not pure,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.540
you still have to aim
for living a life together.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.380
So manage your marriage well.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.500
Zhou Tingyan is worth trusting for life.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.540
The household register is not required
for a marriage certificate now.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.860
That's so convenient.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.820
Jian Cheng.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.940
Yeah?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.380
What kind of wedding

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.270
do you want?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.660
The wedding?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.020
Yeah.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.900
Maybe let's not hold it just yet.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.620
(A moment as sacred as a wedding)

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.000
(should be saved for later,)

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.980
(when Zhou Tingyan meets someone
he truly loves.)

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.820
Alright.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.240
I respect your choice.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.620
Uncle Zhou,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.420
about us getting married,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.780
can we keep it a secret for now?

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.380
(Oh no.)

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.230
(Is he having second thoughts?)

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.230
We've already registered the marriage.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.420
So you can't call me Uncle Zhou anymore.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.780
It doesn't feel right.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.100
Call me by my name.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.140
Zhou Tingyan.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.220
You don't want to announce the wedding.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.960
You mean a secret marriage?

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.380
No.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.980
Just keeping it quiet for now.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.980
I just ended my engagement
with Zhou Yufeng.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.650
If news of our marriage gets out now,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.260
I'm worried people will twist the story.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.460
So till when,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.540
exactly?

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.940
Until…

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.100
Isn't Zhou Yufeng marrying Jiang Yawei?

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.440
We'll wait until they're married.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.180
Alright.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.380
We'll do it your way.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.700
You feel cold?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.220
(Jian Cheng)

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.500
(Tang)

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.740
Sorry.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.940
The person you're calling

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.380
is busy making money.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.180
Cheng,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.660
when are we going to see Zhou Yufeng?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.220
I'm so eager, so excited.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.900
I can't wait to see his shocked face.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.270
You better take me with you.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.540
I want a front-row seat.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.100
Alright, keep that excitement in check.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.460
As for me and him,

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.100
it's a secret for now.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.300
Alright.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.460
I'll just hold it in for now.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.100
Right now, I'm shopping

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.540
with my future mother-in-law.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.740
I'm planning to get you

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.300
a couple of stunning nightwear sets.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.220
So you can show them to Zhou Tingyan.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.740
Zhou Tingyan and I
have already registered the marriage.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.900
He can't run away.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.060
You should just wear them yourself,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.360
to drive Qin Zhuo crazy

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.880
and get that marriage registered soon.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.460
You cut me to the quick.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.580
We're done.

You little rascal,

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.520
I asked you to shop with Tang yesterday.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.260
Why didn't you go?

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.890
If you dare to stand her up next time,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.740
you will be doomed.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.260
Drink it up.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.970
You're in a good mood today.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.740
I got married.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.820
What?

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.940
I only told you this

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.220
because you seemed down.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.380
But

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.840
you have to keep this secret now.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.620
Definitely.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.580
Who are you marrying?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.340
Jian Cheng!

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.380
I knew it.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.270
You've liked her for a long time,
haven't you?

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.020
In the past,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.780
she never came to me,

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.500
so I couldn't help her.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.500
Because my status is special.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.300
Zhou Yufeng and his mom resents me.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.900
If I helped her too much,

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.990
they'd blame Jian Cheng.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.860
But now

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.500
she's my wife.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.140
From now on,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.180
I can openly protect her.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.100
So this is

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.220
a long-planned love.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.900
You finally get what you want.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.180
Oh gosh.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.900
My buddy's married now.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.020
Well then,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.300
as a brother, I won't hold back.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.500
Your honeymoon trip's on me.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.900
Pretty decent, right?

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.820
Sorry.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.140
The person you're calling

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.460
is busy making money.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.980
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.820
Send one even if it's not. Thanks.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.740
Zhou Tingyan.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.100
Hello?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.140
Jian Cheng.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.960
Where do you want to go
for the honeymoon?

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.540
Honeymoon?

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.780
We're still going on a honeymoon?

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.740
Yeah.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.820
We don't hold the wedding party.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.540
We can't skip it anymore.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.770
Otherwise, I'd feel like
I'm letting you down.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.900
So,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.140
you pick a place you like.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.420
You decide where to go.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.820
Just let me know in advance.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.280
I'll clear my schedule for it.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.420
Whoa.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.540
I don't feel let down at all.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.380
Jian Cheng,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.140
you're young,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.380
beautiful,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.420
and smart.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.060
I really think you deserve better.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.740
But as for me,

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.500
my life is dull,

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.900
boring, and monotonous.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.180
Honestly, I don't have many strengths.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.420
And about that thing

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.900
in High School…

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.900
Jian Cheng, if I want to marry someone,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.540
no one dares to interfere.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.180
Mm-hm.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.420
Of course, I trust you with everything.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.300
Get some rest early.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.380
Hey.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.740
What are you doing?

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.810
That's way too cheesy, man.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.620
Oh my god.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.500
Jian Cheng,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.020
if I want to marry someone,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.420
no one dares to interfere.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.380
(Would someone really not mind?)

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.420
I've been trying

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.180
to protect myself.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.260
Please believe me.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.950
It's not that I don't believe you.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.580
I'm just not ready yet.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.660
Look at what

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.600
your daughter has done.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.540
Is she only my daughter?

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.060
How many times have I told you

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.140
to keep an eye on her?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.680
- Every time she apologizes,
- You hit me!

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.820
you're always shielding her.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.780
That's why she caused such a huge mess.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.300
Now the Jian Family's reputation
is in ruins.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.660
After this disgraceful incident,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.060
how can the Zhou Family
still accept you?

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.300
You have been stubborn and reckless.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.360
That's why you got kidnapped.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.520
Cheng,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.380
don't be scared.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.570
Here, have an orange.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.740
Leave her alone.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.700
Brother, if you keep this up,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.420
Mom and Dad will be upset with you too.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.740
Although Jian Cheng's parents

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.100
quickly addressed those vicious rumors,

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.910
they believed them.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.940
That year, when she finally came back,

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.160
she was covered in blood.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.140
If back then

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.140
she really had been…

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.300
There are no ifs.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.900
Now, she's Mrs. Zhou.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.060
The Jian Family lives in the rich area.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.140
If kidnappers wanted her,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.660
they'd just ask for ransom.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.340
But abducting a rich lady,

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.860
then selling her to a human trafficker,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.900
it makes no sense at all.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:07.700
(PTSD Diagnosis;
Jian Cheng)

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.160
There's new intel
on that kidnapping case.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.940
Keep digging.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.500
