Hey.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:29.656
I'm sorry.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.458
So Min.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.628
I used you.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.964
Stop talking. You're bleeding.

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:41.468
Don't forgive me.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.205
Damn it, why did you do that?

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.578
Now, everyone, we need your cooperation.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.080
Please call an ambulance.

Mr. Chairman,
is everything really settled?

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.380
What are you talking about?

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:28.148
I'm talking about what happened today.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.317
What happened?

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.655
A man is dead!

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.091
It was one of my guys' doing.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.294
You were with me golfing,

00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:42.262
so you don't know anything.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.064
You already gave your statement
as a witness.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:45.232
Still,

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:47.467
what really worries me is...

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:51.738
that the victim was
a private equity investor.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.475
If my political career ends...

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.911

The secretary, high on drugs,

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.557
accidentally killed the investor.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.961
Ma Seok Gu supplied the drugs!

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:17.898
We were out all day,
we didn't see a thing.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.533
How many times do I have to repeat it!

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.801
Just how many times!

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.902
How many times!

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.741
Still!

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.582
there was an undercover cop involved.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.687
If that's what worries you, relax,

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.525
He's in a coma.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.628
We just need to make sure
he doesn't wake up.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:53.534
Well then.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.180
This is a real mess!

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:13.187
Tell Ahn I'm on my way.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.522
I want everything prepped,

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:17.324
from strategy meeting to legal counsel.

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:23.263
Call Commissioner Park right now.

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.565
Yes, sir.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:34.741
Hey.

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:38.445
Find out which hospital
Park Jeong Hun is at, now.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:40.914
And Seok Gu.

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:42.850
Get rid of him right now.

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:44.117
Yes, sir.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.023
I need to find out where he is
and deal with him.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.193
(Chairman Kim Doo Sik)

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:54.962
Have you eaten, Chairman?

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:02.536
Wait.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.707
What are you still doing here?

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.714
I think you might need this.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:21.788
Did you hear?

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.490
Hear what?

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.230
What, that all this...

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.634
happened because I sold the drugs?

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.571
Or that you ordered him to get rid of me?

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.907
- That's not...
- Let me make you an offer.

00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:43.477
I'll give this to you, Chairman.

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:44.645
In return,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.314
you have to give me what I want.

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:55.689
This seat.

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:02.629
How do I know...

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.767
that little device is even what I need?

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.368
Why should I believe you?

00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:10.137
My goodness.

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.508
You always need proof for everything,
don't you?

00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:16.543
Right?

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:28.255
Take a look for yourself, Chairman.

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:33.760
Chairman.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:43.937
We're back, sir.

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.239
You're back earlier than I expected.

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:47.441
I retrieved the slush fund
you mentioned, sir.

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:52.579
It's me.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.382
Tell them to call off the arrest operation
on Ma Seok Gu.

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:03.023
Sir, you know what I mean.

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.692
I was speaking figuratively.

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:09.363
Even with the drugs and hit-and-run death,

00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:10.631
the media has been silent.

00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:12.933
You know better than anyone why.

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.279
I've got no reason to say yes.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.015
Whether I get it or not,

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:30.884
you'll still want my spot.

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:33.787
Let's see what you can do.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.161
That's disappointing to hear.

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:42.996
Seok Gu.

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:45.265
Do you remember what I told you?

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:49.636
I brought you this far
because I believed in your confidence.

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:51.305
Thanks to that,

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:54.241
I've gotten this far.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.211
Right.

00:07:58.045 --> 00:07:59.880
I put you where you are,

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.917
and you're not even worth it.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.488
Watching some rookie girl...

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.191
play you like a fool made me realize...

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:14.561
that even the position you hold
is more than you deserve.

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:22.369
After all the dirty work I've done,

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:27.441
after staying loyal,

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:31.178
and yet you throw me away
whenever I'm not needed?

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:32.446
Damn it.

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:37.985
You don't give a damn about me?

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:40.821
Seok Gu.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:43.423
You've always been my lapdog,

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.859
then and now.

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:50.631
Fucking hell!

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:03.243
Goddamn old bastard...

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.380
won’t stop pissing me off!

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.614
Ahh!

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:10.884
Ahh!

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.928
It's me.

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:24.464
I'm heading to China now.
Have a boat ready.

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:28.502
And there's someone
I want you to bring in.

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:31.738
Congressman!

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.180
Commissioner, how's your son doing?

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.750
I've been told he's unconscious.

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.157
Your son...

00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:52.526
ruined everything for us!

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:54.461
That bastard!

00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:58.232
I mean, that kid was working for...

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.200
Chairman Kim to bring us down.
Did you know that?

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.570
I didn't know that far.

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:06.773
Lucky he's in a coma.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.742
The moment he wakes,

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.344
it's the end of all of us!

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.916
We can't even trust Chairman Kim anymore.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.620
I'm at my wits' end.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:26.960
Please,

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:33.500
you need to handle this.

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:37.704
What do you mean?

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.075
You need to make sure...

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.045
your son never wakes up.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:46.980
If you do,

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:49.883
we can bury this matter on our end,

00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:52.052
one way or another.

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:54.955
If we get through this one,

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:58.125
I'll do whatever it takes
to secure your nomination.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.329

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:22.109
Don't sleep too long.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.848
I'll come back tomorrow.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.586
Don’t mention I was here.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:33.687
Carry on.

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:42.329
Where should I drive you?

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:43.564
Let's head to Cheongdam-dong.

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.077
Listen up, everyone. Detective Yoon.

00:12:57.077 --> 00:12:57.878
Yes, sir.

00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:00.247
Call the homicide unit and find out...

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:02.015

- Yes, sir.

- Detective Kim.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.485
You know the private equity fund
investor case?

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:08.255
Analyze the victim's financial records
and send them over!

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:09.189
Yes, sir.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.358
My goodness.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.460
Listen,

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:18.065
I don't remember a thing
after taking that drug from Ma.

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:19.733
So you're really sticking with that story?

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:22.836
You think...

00:13:23.337 --> 00:13:25.038
Chairman Kim left you anything?

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.208
Hate to break it to you,

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:31.211

not even a penny in your name.

Come in.

Commissioner.

00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:59.473
Have you seen
the messages for the Commissioner?

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.241
No, why?

The team in charge called.

00:14:03.577 --> 00:14:05.145
This case is sensitive,

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:07.114

Who did this?

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.550
Who the hell is it?

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:49.990
Who else knows?

00:14:58.332 --> 00:14:59.266
Commissioner.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.804
Don't you want to know?

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:06.406
The messages for the Commissioner.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.841
What?

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:11.945
You want me to repeat it louder?

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.717
Why didn't you come in yourself yesterday?

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:21.388
We're done as father and son.

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:25.826
I suppose turning yourself in
isn't an option.

00:15:25.993 --> 00:15:26.894
Turning myself in?

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.131
That's ridiculous.

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:34.101
Why would I turn myself in
when I didn't do anything wrong?

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.305
If you're not coming down on your own,

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:41.875
I'll have to bring you down myself.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.714
(Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu)

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:49.416
We found it on his clothes from that day.

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:51.685
Get it out of my sight.

00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:54.588
He must've had a tough time,

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:57.357
having a corrupt cop for a father.

00:15:57.357 --> 00:15:58.492
Enough, stop!

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:05.766
You can't really hate your own family,

00:16:05.766 --> 00:16:07.568
no matter how hard you try.

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:12.806
Maybe that's why.

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:20.280
Park Jeong Hun...

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.750
might still care for you, Commissioner.

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:44.271
Yes.

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:48.809
I'll be right over.

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.036
So far,

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:17.804
digital forensics confirmed...

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:20.207
the suspect's server.

00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:23.810
We're checking if there are...

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.978
any more phishing victims.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:26.446
What about Ma Seok Gu?

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:28.248
We don't have solid evidence yet.

00:17:28.649 --> 00:17:31.652
so it's hard to confirm it's him.

00:17:31.652 --> 00:17:32.686
Also, since yesterday,

00:17:32.686 --> 00:17:34.988
that IP hasn't been detected in Korea.

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:36.657
So that means...

00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:39.560
he's left Korea.

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:43.263
- Jong Chan.
- Yes, Chief.

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:44.131
What's he saying?

00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:47.501
He's been quiet
ever since he heard about...

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.236
Chairman Kim's death.

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:50.737
No surprise he's silent.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.172
The dead say nothing.

00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:54.641
Well then.

00:17:56.543 --> 00:17:57.444
My goodness.

00:18:02.216 --> 00:18:04.484
Chairman Kim is dead?

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.120
So Min.

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:12.893
You saw Detective Park
at the hospital, right?

00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:15.562
How's he holding up?

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:17.364
Still unconscious.

00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:19.199
Do you think he'll be okay?

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.701
Let's hope so.

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:22.603
This is exhausting.

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.505
He needs to wake up...

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:26.573
so we can handle those scumbags.

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:30.544
We only have circumstantial evidence.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:32.846
Is there no other evidence?

00:18:33.347 --> 00:18:35.716
Detective Park must've gathered evidence.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.252
We looked everywhere.
Nothing turned up.

00:18:38.752 --> 00:18:40.687
It's either too small to see...

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:42.956
or someone took it.

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.660
Anyway, let me know when he wakes up.

00:18:47.094 --> 00:18:47.895
Sure.

00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:17.524
What if the Ilseong clan is tailing you?
You're reckless.

00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:19.560
I'm heading to China.
Make the preparations.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.395
What? You're going again?

00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:23.764
Jeong Hun had evidence.

00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:25.699
Ma Seok Gu must have taken it.

00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:28.869
He even killed Chairman Kim.

00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:30.437
Who knows what he’ll do next.

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:34.174
What do you need me to prepare?

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:36.410
Park Kye Sun.

00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:38.378
Make it again.

00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:46.820
You're here, Chairman.

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.924
What's the status on the guy
I told you to bring in?

00:19:50.924 --> 00:19:52.993
Yes, perfect timing.

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:54.394
He's almost here too.

00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:56.496
Mr. Chairman.

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.332
I'll serve you as best I can.

00:19:58.899 --> 00:20:00.501
Just tell me anything you need.

00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:02.536
Anything I need?

00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:04.137
Yes, sir.

00:20:04.137 --> 00:20:05.439
Where are you from?

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:06.540
China or Korea?

00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:08.175
Heilongjiang, China.

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:10.644
Heilongjiang?

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:11.845
Yes.

00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:12.713
You're adorable.

00:20:15.249 --> 00:20:16.083
Thank you, sir.

00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:31.698
Yeah, this is where I belong.

00:20:34.301 --> 00:20:35.969
(CEO MA SEOK GU)

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:41.775
(I will go to China. Death is near.)

00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:42.676
Kye Sun?

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:46.346
Park Kye Sun?

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.850
(Kye_sun)

00:20:58.125 --> 00:20:59.426
It's me, Park Kye Sun.

00:20:59.793 --> 00:21:00.594
Hey.

00:21:02.062 --> 00:21:03.030
Hey, you!

00:21:04.164 --> 00:21:06.366
Park Kye Sun, you clearly...

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:07.768
Are you disappointed that I'm still alive?

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:09.736
I heard...

00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:12.973
Chairman Kim's dead.

00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:17.411
We can’t leave that position empty.

00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:23.183
It's already mine.

00:21:23.183 --> 00:21:25.786
If anything happens to me,

00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:28.956
Ma Seok Gu will be responsible.

00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:34.328
(Will)

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.699
I even have his will.

00:21:40.434 --> 00:21:42.536
He's a pain till the very end.

00:21:43.837 --> 00:21:44.671
Yeah.

00:21:45.572 --> 00:21:48.342
I’m thinking of going to the cops myself.
What do you say?

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:50.978
Aren't you curious what will happen?

00:21:51.445 --> 00:21:53.914
Damn it, I killed you before!

00:21:53.914 --> 00:21:55.015
You're dead!

00:21:59.953 --> 00:22:01.188
Stay put, you bastard.

00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:04.291
Get on your knees.

00:22:10.197 --> 00:22:12.733
Seok Gu.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.469
Speak or I'll end you.

00:22:16.436 --> 00:22:18.071
Did you really kill Park Kye Sun
back then?

00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:20.374
Here's the thing. What happened was...

00:22:20.374 --> 00:22:21.542
I'm sorry, Seok Gu.

00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:23.177
I screwed up, forgive me!

00:22:23.177 --> 00:22:24.545
I messed up!

00:22:24.545 --> 00:22:25.646
- Please forgive me!
- You little shit.

00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:28.148
Fuck!

00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:33.687
Fuck, you set me up?

00:22:36.056 --> 00:22:36.890
Get up.

00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:38.492
Get up, you son of a bitch.

00:22:39.293 --> 00:22:40.127
Get up!

00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:43.030
You told Park Kye Sun...

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.799
to send Kim Mi Yang's daughter to me,
right?

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:46.700
No.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.635
I really didn't know...

00:22:49.136 --> 00:22:51.305
who she was, I swear.

00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:53.941
You disgusting bastard.

00:22:56.076 --> 00:22:57.477
Out of nowhere!

00:22:58.011 --> 00:22:59.346
Park Kye Sun started...

00:23:00.781 --> 00:23:04.785
showed her face on messenger
and threatened me.

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:06.720
Messenger? She showed her face?

00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:08.722
You didn't meet in person?

00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:11.258
No, I never saw her...

00:23:11.258 --> 00:23:13.694
never in person.

00:23:16.597 --> 00:23:17.698
Well, well.

00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:22.703
I really owe you a lot...

00:23:22.703 --> 00:23:25.072
for all your help, right?

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.577
So... can I go now?

00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:32.379
Nope.

00:23:34.381 --> 00:23:36.149
You still owe me something.

00:23:36.483 --> 00:23:39.486
What? What do you mean?

00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:41.188
Take it easy, okay?

00:23:41.188 --> 00:23:43.023
Seok Gu, what exactly do I owe you?

00:23:43.023 --> 00:23:44.691
What is it? What?

00:23:44.691 --> 00:23:46.426
Seok Gu! What do I owe you?

00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:49.196
You damn bastards, aren't you letting go?

00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:50.831
Let go.

00:23:50.831 --> 00:23:52.165
Let go!

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:53.867
Your finger's going to get cut off.

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:55.402
Seok Gu!

00:23:55.402 --> 00:23:56.336
Seok Gu!

00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:58.972
Seok Gu! Hey!

00:24:01.642 --> 00:24:03.410
- Heilong.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.312
I need you to go to Korea...

00:24:05.612 --> 00:24:06.847
and eliminate someone.

00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:08.916
If you succeed,

00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:11.118
I'll put you in charge.

00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:11.919
Can you handle that?

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:13.420
Thank you, sir.

00:24:20.294 --> 00:24:22.596
(Kye_sun)

00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:25.799
What do you want?

00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:29.536
I hate one-sided deals.

00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:31.872
Let's make it fair.

00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:33.140
Go ahead.

00:24:33.707 --> 00:24:36.076
I'm listening, you cunning bastard.

00:24:36.844 --> 00:24:37.911
It's simple.

00:24:38.946 --> 00:24:40.948
I'll turn a blind eye
to the chairman's death.

00:24:42.716 --> 00:24:44.051
Just give me that seat.

00:24:45.853 --> 00:24:47.988
You want the chairman's spot?

00:24:48.288 --> 00:24:51.024
I’ve lost a lot of time because of you.

00:24:52.793 --> 00:24:54.895
That much should be okay, don't you think?

00:24:54.895 --> 00:24:55.762
You think so?

00:24:57.564 --> 00:24:59.566
Then show me what you'll give.

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:02.269
Stick to what you're good at,

00:25:02.603 --> 00:25:04.438
rather than a construction company.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.808
(Lux VIP CEO Ma Seok Gu)

00:25:09.243 --> 00:25:10.878
I know a lot of people everywhere.

00:25:10.878 --> 00:25:13.514
I can hook you up with them.

00:25:17.551 --> 00:25:18.418
Deal.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.921
So you just need this camera?

00:25:21.388 --> 00:25:22.789
Let's sign the contract first.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.293
We already agreed verbally.

00:25:26.293 --> 00:25:27.327
Isn't that enough?

00:25:28.829 --> 00:25:30.430
Let’s handle this face-to-face.

00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:32.065
If I leave now,

00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:34.635
I can get to Wari Port at around 9 p.m.
How's that?

00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:38.639
Sure.

00:25:38.872 --> 00:25:40.974
Just one thing. Come alone.

00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:43.377
Don't bring any company.

00:25:43.544 --> 00:25:44.945
Don't worry, I won't.

00:25:45.812 --> 00:25:49.082
In secret deals,
only the parties should meet, right?

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.953
I just don't trust anyone.

00:25:54.087 --> 00:25:55.822
See you later then.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:11.305
Taxi.

00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:17.811
(Park O Hun)

00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:39.666
(Park O Hun)

00:27:18.872 --> 00:27:19.773
Who are you?

00:28:17.464 --> 00:28:18.632
Well, well.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.335
If it isn't Wei Chang Yu.

00:28:23.103 --> 00:28:24.004
Wait, no.

00:28:24.471 --> 00:28:26.907
Kim Mi Yang's daughter is here.

00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:28.942
I just gave a little push,

00:28:28.942 --> 00:28:30.744
and you came running all the way.

00:28:36.416 --> 00:28:37.985
You must be confused.

00:28:37.985 --> 00:28:40.387
This isn't what you expected, right?

00:28:44.658 --> 00:28:45.659
Cunning bastard.

00:28:47.528 --> 00:28:49.897
That's what Park Kye Sun used to call me.

00:28:49.897 --> 00:28:50.664
Not the other way around.

00:28:52.366 --> 00:28:53.233
Welcome.

00:28:53.867 --> 00:28:55.169
I was getting bored.

00:28:55.736 --> 00:28:58.005
Let's have a sincere talk, So Min.

00:29:01.575 --> 00:29:02.442
You want me to go first?

00:29:03.377 --> 00:29:04.411
Where do I start?

00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:07.748
How did your mom look before she died?

00:29:08.382 --> 00:29:09.216
Or maybe...

00:29:10.217 --> 00:29:12.152
how much your dad's loan limit was?

00:29:12.152 --> 00:29:14.388
Shut the fuck up!

00:29:16.723 --> 00:29:18.425
That's not it?

00:29:20.594 --> 00:29:22.496
Then should I tell you my plan?

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.831
From now on,

00:29:25.132 --> 00:29:27.601
everyone around you will suffer,
one by one.

00:29:28.135 --> 00:29:28.936
Why?

00:29:30.003 --> 00:29:32.606
I'll make it happen.

00:29:35.375 --> 00:29:36.343
You jerk!

00:29:36.977 --> 00:29:38.512
You son of a bitch.

00:29:44.952 --> 00:29:46.520
Hey, take it easy.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.821
That's enough, stop it.

00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:55.362
Let's see.

00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:57.297
Who should we start with?

00:29:57.297 --> 00:29:59.333
I did this one, and this one too.

00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:00.467
Okay.

00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:01.335
Hey.

00:30:04.104 --> 00:30:05.205
All right.

00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:10.944
Auntie, it's me, So Min.

00:30:11.178 --> 00:30:12.646
Why are you crying, sweetie?

00:30:13.247 --> 00:30:14.481
Did something happen again?

00:30:15.182 --> 00:30:18.652
Auntie, I've been kidnapped!
Please help me!

00:30:18.652 --> 00:30:20.153
What? Kidnapped?

00:30:20.454 --> 00:30:22.456
Where are you?

00:30:22.689 --> 00:30:24.625
I don't know where I am.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.762
Is this a voice-phishing call?

00:30:30.764 --> 00:30:34.234
My goodness, she's so doubtful.

00:30:36.503 --> 00:30:37.838
See for yourself, ma'am.

00:30:41.542 --> 00:30:43.744
Oh no, Min! Where are you?

00:30:44.611 --> 00:30:47.548
Please don't kill Min!

00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:49.383
Please help!

00:30:49.383 --> 00:30:52.119
What can you possibly do
in this situation?

00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:55.455
Min!

00:30:55.455 --> 00:30:57.558
- Hey, get her out of the way.
- What do I do?

00:31:02.563 --> 00:31:05.432
What can you actually do?

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.014
Hwa Young, it's me, So Min.

00:31:21.448 --> 00:31:22.983
Can you talk right now?

00:31:23.483 --> 00:31:26.987
I'm trying to get revenge on the guy
who killed my mom.

00:31:27.287 --> 00:31:28.388
But I'm short on cash.

00:31:29.356 --> 00:31:31.658
If I miss this shot,
I won't get another chance.

00:31:32.092 --> 00:31:33.093
Eun Bi.

00:31:33.527 --> 00:31:35.128
Please think it over.

00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:37.364
You know I don't usually ask for favors.

00:31:38.398 --> 00:31:40.968
Remember when we acted together?

00:31:44.438 --> 00:31:46.673
I'm pretty smart.

00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:49.076
I'm great at improvising.

00:31:56.216 --> 00:31:59.019
I made this money in just one day.

00:32:02.756 --> 00:32:04.324
Then and now,

00:32:05.526 --> 00:32:07.261
you couldn't protect your people.

00:32:08.061 --> 00:32:08.996
Pathetic bitch.

00:32:16.503 --> 00:32:17.538
I took care of him.

00:32:17.538 --> 00:32:18.939
Good work.

00:32:22.976 --> 00:32:24.044
Wow.

00:32:28.815 --> 00:32:29.917
Ta-da.

00:32:30.984 --> 00:32:32.586
Guess whose this is?

00:32:36.256 --> 00:32:40.060
Such a delicate finger, Detective Park.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.894
Right?

00:32:44.131 --> 00:32:48.001
I always get what I want,
that's how I roll.

00:32:50.237 --> 00:32:51.338
You son of a bitch.

00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:52.806
Let go!

00:32:57.544 --> 00:32:59.880
- Well done.
- Thanks.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.582
You really wanted to be in charge?

00:33:03.217 --> 00:33:04.484
This is the final test.

00:33:06.186 --> 00:33:06.987
Her.

00:33:07.454 --> 00:33:08.822
Kill her in front of my eyes.

00:33:21.768 --> 00:33:22.736
Don't.

00:33:37.784 --> 00:33:39.119
Are you nuts?

00:33:39.686 --> 00:33:41.088
What the hell are you doing?

00:33:45.826 --> 00:33:46.727
Can't you tell?

00:33:50.998 --> 00:33:52.933
This is the moment
you have to beg for your life.

00:33:59.206 --> 00:34:02.509
Looks like you forgot. That's sad.

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:04.011
Cunning bastard.

00:34:04.811 --> 00:34:05.879
Park Kye Sun.

00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:08.882
You really were alive?

00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:16.490
Detective, you need to check this out.

00:34:19.293 --> 00:34:21.562
While you were hospitalized,
we did some digging.

00:34:21.562 --> 00:34:24.765
(Fingerprint analysis report)

00:34:24.765 --> 00:34:26.533
(Probability of identical person- 99.999%)

00:34:34.107 --> 00:34:34.975
Yes

00:34:35.509 --> 00:34:36.777
Is this Ms. In Ye Hyang?

00:34:37.544 --> 00:34:39.546
I'm Park Jeong Hun
from the voice-phishing unit.

00:34:41.348 --> 00:34:42.850
If you have a moment,

00:34:43.684 --> 00:34:44.952
can we talk?

00:34:58.131 --> 00:34:59.233
Kye Sun?

00:35:01.869 --> 00:35:02.970
It's been a while.

00:35:06.907 --> 00:35:08.308
Do you know...

00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:12.346
how long I had to hide in Korea
because of you, cunning bastard?

00:35:13.614 --> 00:35:15.849
I worried you might come after my son too.

00:35:15.849 --> 00:35:16.950
So I went into hiding...

00:35:17.951 --> 00:35:19.353
again and again.

00:35:20.687 --> 00:35:21.555
Because of...

00:35:23.023 --> 00:35:25.359
that sneaky Kim,

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:28.862
we end up meeting like this.

00:35:28.862 --> 00:35:29.696
What?

00:35:30.597 --> 00:35:32.299
Did you really think...

00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:35.369
that spot would be yours if I disappeared?

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.038
But guess what?

00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:43.544
It's your turn to vanish.

00:36:15.576 --> 00:36:16.944
Freeze!

00:36:16.944 --> 00:36:17.811
Police!

00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:22.249
Freeze!

00:36:25.586 --> 00:36:27.321
Police! Freeze!

00:36:34.628 --> 00:36:35.529
You bastard.

00:36:37.431 --> 00:36:39.299
Hand over Jeong Hun's evidence.

00:36:41.368 --> 00:36:42.369
Wow.

00:36:42.936 --> 00:36:46.039
So you really want me to end you, huh?

00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:49.276
What evidence? This thing?

00:36:52.412 --> 00:36:53.380
Oh boy.

00:36:58.318 --> 00:37:00.187
Too late. It's gone.

00:37:05.125 --> 00:37:06.059
Come here.

00:37:06.426 --> 00:37:09.129
I'll kill you just like I did your mom.

00:37:09.129 --> 00:37:10.063
Huh?

00:37:14.835 --> 00:37:15.736
Hey.

00:37:18.572 --> 00:37:20.741
Does that hurt?

00:37:22.476 --> 00:37:23.377
Shit!

00:37:34.054 --> 00:37:35.422
Hey, come here.

00:37:40.227 --> 00:37:41.094
You little shit.

00:37:42.496 --> 00:37:45.399
I clawed my way to the top,

00:37:45.399 --> 00:37:47.267
and you cling to me like a leech.

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:49.970
Do you know what your mom did?

00:37:50.437 --> 00:37:52.873
Please, don't kill me.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.575
Try it yourself!

00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:25.439
Does it hurt?

00:38:26.206 --> 00:38:28.375
If this hurts you,
imagine how much my dad suffered!

00:38:30.644 --> 00:38:31.879
And my mom!

00:38:35.282 --> 00:38:37.317
What about my mom!

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:13.520
So Min!

00:39:40.814 --> 00:39:43.083
There’s been a huge public debate...

00:39:43.083 --> 00:39:46.253
over the case where Ha,
a voice phishing victim,

00:39:46.653 --> 00:39:49.323
took revenge herself on the ringleader.

00:39:50.224 --> 00:39:53.193
What are your thoughts on this incident?

00:39:53.193 --> 00:39:54.728
The victim took matters into
her own hands...

00:39:55.195 --> 00:39:57.998
because law enforcement...

00:39:57.998 --> 00:39:59.399
couldn't solve it.

00:40:00.033 --> 00:40:02.436
Victim protection laws must be updated...

00:40:02.436 --> 00:40:05.172
to prevent this from happening again.

00:40:05.172 --> 00:40:06.507
Still,

00:40:06.507 --> 00:40:09.810
when the law is ignored,
society falls into chaos.

00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:12.813
Because individuals
can't take the law's place.

00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:15.816
There should be a discussion,

00:40:16.884 --> 00:40:18.952
but ignoring judicial procedures...

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.355
is unacceptable.

00:40:21.722 --> 00:40:24.458
Viewer reactions on social media are...

00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:26.927
very heated in real time.

00:40:27.694 --> 00:40:31.164
Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu
turned himself in for collusion.

00:40:31.164 --> 00:40:34.168
He was escorted to the prosecution,

00:40:34.168 --> 00:40:36.069
leaving only an apology.

00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:37.037
My fellow citizens,

00:40:38.172 --> 00:40:39.573
I sincerely apologize for...

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.075
the trouble I've caused.

00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:43.744
Earlier,

00:40:43.744 --> 00:40:47.447
Congressman Seo Jung Geun
was also taken into custody...

00:40:47.447 --> 00:40:49.516
and is now under investigation
by the prosecutors.

00:40:49.516 --> 00:40:52.686
The hero who cut off their tails...

00:40:52.686 --> 00:40:55.389
was surprisingly Park,
the son of the former commissioner,

00:40:55.389 --> 00:40:56.790
and a detective
at the Seongan Police Agency.

00:41:11.038 --> 00:41:11.839
Are you all right?

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.708
I'm fine, and you?

00:41:21.181 --> 00:41:23.884
I'm not sure.

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:27.454
I don't know how to live from here.

00:41:30.924 --> 00:41:32.159
You don't need to rush.

00:41:33.093 --> 00:41:34.862
Just keep going your way,

00:41:34.862 --> 00:41:36.196
at your own pace.

00:41:38.632 --> 00:41:40.734
If the path ends, make a new one.

00:41:41.401 --> 00:41:43.203
If a path doesn't feel right,

00:41:43.203 --> 00:41:44.171
don't take it.

00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:47.174
Going your own way...

00:41:47.608 --> 00:41:50.010
doesn't mean it's wrong.

00:41:52.145 --> 00:41:55.015
I didn't know you could say
something like that.

00:41:58.385 --> 00:41:59.253
What I'm saying is,

00:42:00.087 --> 00:42:01.889
just follow your heart...

00:42:02.189 --> 00:42:03.624
like you've always done.

00:42:05.325 --> 00:42:06.860
I'll always be supporting you.

00:42:12.065 --> 00:42:13.000
Thanks.

00:42:41.628 --> 00:42:44.565
(Five years later)

00:42:53.373 --> 00:42:55.509
(Door securely locked)

00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:59.446
Number 181.

00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:01.181
Your sentence ends today.

00:43:01.782 --> 00:43:03.851
You've held up well.

00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:05.919
Your parents will appreciate it.

00:43:06.587 --> 00:43:09.323
Go out now and live your life.

00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:12.392
That's what your parents
would want for you.

00:43:57.604 --> 00:43:59.206
(Kim Do Jin)

00:44:01.775 --> 00:44:02.609
Yes, Do Jin?

00:44:02.609 --> 00:44:04.645
Did you see my present?

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.247
Present?

00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:10.584
I put it in your pocket
when we met earlier.

00:44:10.584 --> 00:44:11.585
Look for it.

00:44:12.686 --> 00:44:15.422
I stayed up all night preparing
after hearing you were getting out.

00:44:18.625 --> 00:44:20.194
A flash drive? What's this?

00:44:21.361 --> 00:44:22.196
You want to know?

00:44:24.031 --> 00:44:25.933
If you want to know, pay a dime.

00:44:25.933 --> 00:44:26.900
I'll hang up.

00:44:34.675 --> 00:44:36.410
Min, can you hear me?

00:44:38.045 --> 00:44:38.912
Mom.

00:44:39.513 --> 00:44:40.514
Have you eaten?

00:44:41.248 --> 00:44:44.484
Sweetheart, have you had a hard time
because of me?

00:44:45.185 --> 00:44:48.922
I only ever wanted you to be happy,
sweetheart.

00:44:49.423 --> 00:44:52.726
Somehow, I think I ended up
hurting you more.

00:44:55.262 --> 00:44:57.030
But you know what?

00:44:57.865 --> 00:45:02.069
I thought I'd given you so much love.

00:45:02.703 --> 00:45:03.770
But actually,

00:45:04.004 --> 00:45:07.708
the one who got the love was me.

00:45:10.978 --> 00:45:11.879
You,

00:45:12.713 --> 00:45:16.483
simply existing, bring me joy...

00:45:17.351 --> 00:45:18.418
and love.

00:45:21.255 --> 00:45:23.290
Then why didn't you come into my dreams?

00:45:24.024 --> 00:45:26.126
I got so much from you.

00:45:27.494 --> 00:45:29.062
I'm really sorry.

00:45:30.163 --> 00:45:32.766
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you enough.

00:45:34.034 --> 00:45:36.837
I'm sorry for being against you
pursuing acting.

00:45:38.805 --> 00:45:41.542
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it to...

00:45:42.676 --> 00:45:44.211
a single one of your shows.

00:45:46.346 --> 00:45:47.814
So here's my question.

00:45:48.649 --> 00:45:50.083
If you were born again.

00:45:51.818 --> 00:45:52.953
would you still want to be my daughter?

00:45:56.256 --> 00:45:58.725
I promise I'd do so much better then.

00:45:59.993 --> 00:46:01.195
You would, right?

00:46:05.832 --> 00:46:09.169
Sweetheart, you've become a lead actress.

00:46:09.169 --> 00:46:11.104
I'm not worried about you at all.

00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:15.075
Go out there and shine, okay?

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.347
Hold your head high
and take care of yourself.

00:46:23.383 --> 00:46:24.384
Sweetheart,

00:46:26.086 --> 00:46:27.554
I love you so much.

00:46:28.722 --> 00:46:31.425
I love you, Min.

00:46:32.693 --> 00:46:34.228
Love you, Min.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.965
I love you.

00:46:44.104 --> 00:46:45.339
I love you too, Mom.

00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:36.690
(No Mercy)
