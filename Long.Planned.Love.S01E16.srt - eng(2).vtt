00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.150
Zhou Lu, are you crazy?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.560
I asked Qin Yingzhi.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.710
She's that big client from Qianyi.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.560
Why act like you don't know her?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.800
You know well

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.150
Cheng has no trust in men right now.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.800
You used to be the one she trusted most.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.260
I told you to confess,
but you didn't dare.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.410
But Zhou Lu, Cheng is doing well now.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.120
And Zhou Tingyan is a great match for her.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.150
You... get what I'm saying?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.690
You think I'm trying to split them up?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.100
Uncle Zhou wants to pursue Cheng,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.430
but he feels she has no feelings for him.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.760
So he came to me.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.150
I suggested to him to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.230
make Cheng feel insecure.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.150
What kind of lousy idea is that?

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.870
You can't use cheating as a tactic.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.480
The crazy part is Zhou Tingyan bought it.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.350
Half and half, I'd say.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.400
What do you mean?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.350
He believed half of it.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.680
Which proves he really does like Cheng

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.430
and shows

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.400
he's pretty decent.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.150
Can you talk like a normal person?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.680
In plain words,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.640
Tang,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.710
no matter what choice Cheng makes,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.710
I'll never do anything that hurts her.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.430
Still not getting it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.190
This is what you don't get.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.710
I stayed up way too late at Qin Zhuo's.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840
Couldn't get up early.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.910
Mr. Qin, even the young
need to take it slow.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.840
Go to the clubhouse.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.200
Meng Tang,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.840
I ran into Mi Shan at the door.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.870
Does that matter?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.240
Of course it matters.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.090
Hers is being renovated,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.240
so I lent her my empty place.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.550
Besides, I said

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.250
I won't start a new relationship

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.520
before the engagement ends.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.520
So,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.680
is the engagement holding you back?

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.270
Is that right?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.310
That's not what I meant.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.550
You know,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.730
why did Cheng love Zhou Yufeng
for so long,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.430
yet let go overnight?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.000
It wasn't just one night.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.430
Cheng gave him many chances.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.960
Guess how many?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.150
A hundred times.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.200
She was unwilling to accept it.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.430
That boy who used to be all about her

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.560
suddenly changed.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.590
So she gave him a hundred chances
to hurt her,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.960
forcing herself to let go.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.560
Even when she lost hope,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.150
she kept telling herself to wait a bit

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.750
until 100 points were all deducted.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.840
I'm not as strong-willed as Cheng.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.310
I still love you even now.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.840
But I do have my pride.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.830
So my perfect score is only ten.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.230
And right now,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.430
you're down to just one point.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.310
That last point is easy to take away.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.840
Once it's gone,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.000
my obsession

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.920
and my refusal to let go

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.070
will all disappear.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.160
I'll go talk to your parents

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.880
to end the engagement.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.160
Who's that?

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.710
A scam call.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.740
(Zhou)

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.630
I'm in a bad mood.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.110
Keep me company.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.430
I'm actually feeling great.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.840
Don't get in my way.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.600
Tang and Qin Zhuo
are at odds like this now.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.720
What are we supposed to do?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.270
When it comes to their relationship,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm on Meng Tang's side.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.950
Back at Mi Shan's restaurant,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.100
I hit Qin Zhuo, you saw that right?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.000
He still has marks.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.870
I think I did notice.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.750
If Qin Zhuo hadn't helped me before

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.620
and I owe him a favor,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.750
I would've hit him.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.670
He helped you?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.840
Mm.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.720
Back when we were abroad,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.630
I got sick and he found me a doctor.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.200
(He...)

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.270
(I took the blame for him.)

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.380
(He owed me a favor.)

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.840
Zhou Tingyan.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.750
Yeah.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.000
Qin Zhuo said there's nothing
with Mi Shan.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.750
Then why does he keep helping her?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.230
Did Mi Shan ever save his life?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.240
Between Qin Zhuo and Mi Shan,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.680
there's no life-saving grace,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.450
but something else.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.590
Like what?

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.720
I promised Qin Zhuo,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.910
it's his secret.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.590
I can't tell anyone.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.270
Alright.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.510
Back when I used to pray to the Buddhists,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.360
I would always wish

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.950
that

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.950
Qin Zhuo would like Tang too.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.160
And that Tang's wishes would come true.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.930
But now?

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.390
I'm actually really glad

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.270
that Qin Zhuo doesn't like Tang.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.510
That's really great.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.110
Why?

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.230
Because…

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.270
Qin Zhuo has Mi Shan.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.310
Qin Zhuo will protect her for life.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.160
That's absolutely not okay.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.560
No woman could accept

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.670
her partner guarding
another woman forever.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.860
Even if there's no romantic feeling?

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.440
He doesn't love Mi Shan.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.070
He just feels indebted.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.510
If Qin Zhuo only loves Tang,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.030
it's fine, isn't it?

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.590
No, still not okay.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.390
Some men are...

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.560
very responsible.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.440
Like repaying a life-saving favor

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.870
with lifelong commitment.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.870
Who said I married you
just for that favor?

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.510
She doesn't even answer your calls?

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.790
Dad.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.750
Why do you get so worked up

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.830
whenever it's about Cheng?

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.670
You have changed.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.520
How could it be the same now?

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.450
She's Zhou Tingyan's wife now.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.470
But Dad,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.390
we're in the middle
of a new product seminar.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.160
The staff are all waiting for us.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.260
You need to be more mindful.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.500
Forget the seminar.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.500
Zhou Tingyan took two projects
from Changsheng Group.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.130
And he's invested in two of
our rival companies.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.940
Everyone thinks he's suppressing us.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.700
Yet he turns around
and protects our turf.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.140
Do you know why?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.260
You mean it's because of Cheng?

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.920
What do you think?

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.260
Everyone else is clueless.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
But I see it crystal clear.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.110
Zhou Tingyan once said,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.780
the rise and fall of Changsheng
is tied to Cheng.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.020
If Cheng's doing well,
Changsheng will thrive.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.460
If Cheng's not, Changsheng will struggle.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.820
He's proving that statement.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.680
You're not that clueless.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.660
Man, right now I...

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.580
Every time I close my eyes,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.300
I see her losing it

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.540
and that Zhou Tingyan

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.060
pointing a baseball bat at me.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.910
(Cheng)
Dad said,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.900
we can sign the share transfer agreement.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.740
On my way.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.580
What did you say?

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.340
In your name,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.700
I tell Cheng it's nine percent.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.540
And get her to sign.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.540
She's on her way.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.300
When we talk later, pay extra attention.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.340
In case that troublemaker
sets me up again.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.580
(Looks like I have to sign today.)

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.860
(Let me think.)

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.700
(Maybe I can still get more benefits)

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.100
(out of Zhou Tingyan.)

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.420
Oh right, the bracelet that

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.340
President Zhang's nephew sent over.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.130
Put it on the desk later.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.340
Dad, Wenqian will be back in a few days.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.640
She loves little trinkets like that.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.060
Better save that bracelet for her.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.540
Cheng isn't into those things.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.540
You...

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.700
You're closest

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.700
with Wenqian.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.860
Talk to her properly

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.940
and help her find someone to marry soon.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.860
Not to be so picky.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.300
Then we can focus on
dealing with Zhou Tingyan.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.760
- Dad.
- Hey.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.180
You're here too.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.440
Didn't go to that date?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.700
It's already set.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.100
Chairman Wang's daughter.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.740
Our families are meeting this week.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.660
I was just about to tell you.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.890
Make sure Zhou Tingyan comes too.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.820
(Wang Niannian and Jian Youhui?)

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.300
Why are you playing matchmaker again?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.460
What do you mean by that?

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.700
Your brother and she really match well.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.220
A good match? Jian Youhui.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.820
Do you think you're worthy of her?

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.060
It's like putting a rose
in the wrong place.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.300
Jian Cheng.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.060
Dad.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.540
I have a meeting.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.900
Uh-huh.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.420
Jian.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.420
Wang Niannian's health isn't great.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.660
Pick someone else to hassle.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.140
H-h-hassle? What do you mean?

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.660
This is called a win-win partnership.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.380
It's just business.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.700
You don't get it.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.460
Fine, I don't get it.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.220
That's why I'm here today.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.940
Hand me my nine percent shares.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.940
I need to practice
with Changsheng Group.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.140
Why do you always target me?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.420
If not you, then who?

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.980
You don't care about me anyway.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.060
I...

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.820
How do I not care about you?

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.980
You want money, I give it to you.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.480
You want something, I give it to you.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.660
I handed 9% share to you just like that.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.980
That was because

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.940
I married Zhou Tingyan

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.060
and I'm his wife.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.320
You didn't use to be like this.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.900
How did I treat you before?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.820
Alright, you want to hear it?

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.700
Then let me list all your wrongs.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.700
In the first year Jian Wenqian came,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.740
she set her eyes on my favorite doll.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.660
You and Ms. Mei made me give it to her.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.420
Even though you both knew

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.660
that was my most treasured doll.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.510
In the second year Jian Wenqian came,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.580
she clearly fell off the swing herself,

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.340
but you only listened to her.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.220
You said I was young

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.820
and wasn't supposed to be so cruel.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.300
In the third year Jian Wenqian came,

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.220
my piano teacher

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.860
gave me four tickets to a concert.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.550
She mentioned,

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.410
she wanted to go with you,
Ms. Mei, and Jian Youhui.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.620
You all left me alone at home.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.160
How could you?

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.530
That was supposed to be my ticket.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.420
In the fourth year Jian Wenqian came,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.100
on my birthday that year,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.300
she pretended to be possessed.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.900
I caused a scene.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.100
You slapped me twice.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.540
Ever since then,

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.460
you never celebrated my birthday again.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.400
In Jian Wenqian's fifth year here,

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.940
she set her sights on my bedroom.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.940
You and Ms. Mei told me
to give it to her.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.100
I refused.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.580
And what did you do?

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.700
You locked me
in the basement storage room.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.960
It was her birthday that day.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.820
You took her out to celebrate

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.460
and completely forgot about me.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.460
It was the middle of winter

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.060
and I was only in a thin layer of clothing.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.820
I was locked in there for a whole day.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.420
If Grandma hadn't come back,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.540
I might've starved to death

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.510
or died of thirst, or suffocated.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.220
In Jian Wenqian's sixth year..

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.420
Alright, alright.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.180
I get it, I understand.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.420
Miss, let me help you.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.540
No need, no need.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.980
Go check on Jian.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.220
His blood pressure's acting up.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.100
Get him some tea, calm him down.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.940
Okay.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.980
Chairman Jian, are you okay?

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.060
Dad's right.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.420
Every time you come,
you act like a burglar.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.300
Just spit it out.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.940
Dad's trying to set me up
with Wang Niannian.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.920
Her dad didn't like
that I'd been married.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.070
He kept brushing it off.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.300
Now that you're married to Zhou Tingyan.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.880
Dad approached him again

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.900
and he agreed,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.460
probably trying to
get close to Zhou Tingyan.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.740
So, what are you trying to say?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.460
I've met Wang Niannian,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.740
and I don't want to marry her.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.820
She doesn't either.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.100
But she can't stand up to her father,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.100
and I can't convince Dad.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:02.940
So,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.420
can you help me out?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.060
Why should I help you?

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.580
You've never been good to me.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.580
You know,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.340
I'm a mess
when it comes to relationships.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.980
You and Wang Niannian were classmates,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.580
and your reaction tells me,

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.820
you don't want her
to marry a mess like me.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.820
At least you know you're a mess.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.820
Guess you know your limits.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:27.820
Go on.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.060
What exactly do you want?

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.480
This week, we're having dinner together.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.740
I need you to be there.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.460
Right there in front of everyone,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.840
tell them you're not into Wang Niannian

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.460
and don't want her as your sister-in-law.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.700
Your backing is Zhou Tingyan.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.700
No one would blame you.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.180
(Oh, great.)

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.940
(He wants me to take the fall)

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.780
(for his romance.)

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.940
Actually…

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.940
Mom's not a fan of Wang Niannian either.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.220
I'll go talk to her.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.060
She'll work with...

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.900
Hold up.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.100
I never agreed to this.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.420
I'm your actual brother.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.140
Right.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.460
You really are my brother.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.820
Jian said you've been eyeing this too

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.580
and want to give it to Jian Wenqian.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.580
But he saved it especially for me.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.060
Youhui.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.740
Back then, you cared about me the most.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.540
You'd spent

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.460
your pocket money
on toys and snacks for me.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.340
You'd give me the best things.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.830
You said,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.060
as long as you're still my brother,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.300
you'd make any wish of mine come true.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.780
Cheng.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.300
Youhui.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.180
I still can't figure it out.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.060
Why has everyone changed so much?

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.860
Ever since Jian Wenqian came,

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.900
all of you started acting differently.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.660
Youhui,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.340
before all this,

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.410
I never did anything unforgivable, right?

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.750
Then why...

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.780
Why did you suddenly
stop caring about me?

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.580
Cheng, I...

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.900
What happened?

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.660
She talked back to you again?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.240
It's all my fault.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.470
If I hadn't brought Wenqian back then,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.860
none of this would've happened.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.540
You can't hide a fire with paper.
