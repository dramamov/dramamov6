[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940
[Episode 33]

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.229
Aren't you always

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.490
by His Majesty's side?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.759
How could

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.370
Bai Shouzhuo be killed out of the blue?

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.280
And he was working for Prince of Zhennan?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.080
Your Majesty,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.229
Eunuch Bai proclaimed his innocence
until death.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.479
It was all the Princess of Susha's
accusation.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.740
The Princess of Susha?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.430
She was involved?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.230
It was the Princess of Susha

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.560
who took His Majesty to arrest Eunuch Bai.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.230
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.920
The Princess of Susha

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.510
never leaves His Majesty's side.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.430
I dared not tell you.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.090
I am guilty.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.979
Your Majesty, please punish me.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.260
You are indeed guilty.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.240
But I want to give you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.840
a chance to atone.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.240
Go kill that bitch.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.829
Whatever method you use,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.500
I just want her dead.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.870
I've been in Shengjing for so many days,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.910
and the Emperor has kept me locked

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.960
in Yeting Palace

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240
and only today allowed me to see you.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.260
Your Highness,

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.340
what happened in Yujing

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.810
has spread throughout Yeting Palace.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.910
What are we going to do now?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.850
You still have me.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.470
Trust me.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.150
One day I will take you home.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.440
But we are in enemy territory.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.350
And you're all alone, Your Highness.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.140
Perhaps I'm not alone.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000
I've inquired about the situation
in Yujing.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.750
It seems no one

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.280
has seen my brother's body.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.640
I've been thinking these past days

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.280
that he must still be alive.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.590
Did you also feel Elder Zhou

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.050
was acting strange today?

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.390
His words today

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.430
seemed like he was testing us.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.760
If you are determined to leave,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.790
will you fight your way out?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.280
Indeed.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.950
There was murderous intent in his eyes.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.750
I could feel it.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.750
He seemed to really want

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.120
me to fight my way out.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.800
Ning Fei,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.360
you've been here the longest

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.760
and know this place best.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.000
Tell us.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.120
What kind of person

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.079
is Elder Zhou?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.240
Usually,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.040
he doesn't seem strange at all.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.840
He always talks about being content

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.900
with a simple life.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.190
Wait.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.660
I remember now.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.079
After I recovered,

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.240
he came to see me.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.240
At that time, he asked me many questions

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.500
about His Highness...

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.750
About Xia Jingshi.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.840
He even inquired

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.590
about my relationship with Xia Jingshi.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.030
After learning about

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.630
my history with Xia Jingshi,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.520
he hinted that I should introduce him
to Xia Jingshi someday.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.540
He wants to ally with Xia Jingshi?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.630
But he's a member of the Storm Alliance.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.360
He can't possibly leave this place.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.890
Unless he's been planning
to leave all along.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.959
Elder Zhou saved my life.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.930
I didn't want to overthink it.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.000
But today I could feel

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.270
he was subtly

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.680
hinting to us

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.610
that the key to leaving this place

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.760
lies with Elder Lei.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.870
Could it be

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.710
that he wants to use us

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.930
against Elder Lei?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.240
He came

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.510
right after you quarreled

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.750
with Lei Lie.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.670
Maybe

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.930
he wants to exploit

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.659
the conflict between you two.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.909
Oh, right.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.560
I just remembered

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.990
something else suspicious.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.290
I once accidentally saw some of

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.720
Elder Zhou's close followers
practicing martial arts.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.960
They're scholars.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.520
They don't need to practice martial arts.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.800
Does anyone else

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.870
in the Storm Alliance know about this?

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.800
No one does, I think.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.040
He's been secretly building his own force,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.570
maybe to stage a rebellion.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.510
It seems he might be

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.770
really planning to move against Lei Lie.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.430
Once you go any farther, you'll be
outside the Storm Alliance's territory.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.960
What are you two doing here?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.560
Bro,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.500
we were ordered by an elder

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.310
to gather herbs on the mountain.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.800
The people from the Woodcutter Branch

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.860
will soon notice something's wrong.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.500
According to the plan,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.630
set up the ambush.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.310
Yes!

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.000
You two,

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.360
guard that entrance.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.870
Yes.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.650
[Great Shelter Hall]

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.170
Godfather.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.630
Zhou Hao is trying
to sneak out of the Storm Alliance

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.030
with some people from the Studying Branch.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.270
How is that possible?

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.360
It's absolutely true.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.720
My men

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.800
spotted their trail;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.060
they left not long ago.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.750
Gather everyone

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.420
and go after them!

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.100
[Storm Alliance]

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.770
Let's go!

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.940
How is it?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.470
Nothing.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.159
Nothing.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.080
Follow me.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.460
Protect Elder Lei!

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.560
Lei Lie!

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.510
Zhou Hao.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.280
What are you doing?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.560
Lei Lie,

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.340
if you don't die,

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.270
I'll be trapped here forever.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.240
Even if I'm fortunate enough

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.370
to escape from here,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560
with your temper,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.510
you'd still hunt me down

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.680
to the ends of the world.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.790
Am I right?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.600
Are you saying

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.800
you want to kill me?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.159
Brothers of the Storm Alliance,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.130
calm down.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.810
Let's sit down and talk this through.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.270
I saved your lives.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.240
Today I'm going to kill Lei Lie,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.900
and you're standing in my way?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.000
Lei Lie,

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.160
after all that's happened,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.790
you've left me no choice!

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.160
Raise the net!

[Great Shelter Hall]

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.550
Go!

00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:59.390
Hurry!

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.150
Go.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.960
This is their family matter;

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.880
let them handle it themselves.

[Storm Alliance]

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.550
I still don't understand

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.870
why you want to kill me.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.870
I understand if others don't get it.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.750
But you?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.480
Why?

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.600
Didn't your two sons

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.270
also die

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.470
right in front of you?

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:42.910
Have you forgotten

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.910
those desperate looks in their eyes

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.670
before they died?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.870
I haven't forgotten for a single day.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.600
You say you haven't forgotten,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.560
but in your heart you already have.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.200
But I dare not forget.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.480
My dead husband

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.150
and my unborn child—

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.910
this blood debt—even if it turned to ash,

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.990
I dare not forget.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.720
So I will kill Feng Suige!

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.550
Do you understand now?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.670
I will kill him!

are alive today

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.320
because of Qingyu's kindness?

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.600
What about my child?

Did they die for nothing?

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.360
You want to repay kindness

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.220
and seek revenge at the same time?

Dream on!

You've also heard that

our enemy

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.510
might not be Feng Pingcheng.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.320
What if we're really wrong?

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.240
I can't afford to be wrong.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:41.540
The whole Storm Alliance is watching me.

If I point to the wrong enemy,

everyone will follow me
into the same mistake.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.390
Why bother discussing this anymore?

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.270
At this point,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.610
I accept our defeat.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.360
If you want to kill me, then do it.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.870
No need for this pretense.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.900
She is full of hatred

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.550
that cannot be eased right now.

I don't blame her.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.720
You're well-educated.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.790
Why did you do this?

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.640
So you know I'm well-educated?

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.320
Scholars should pass the imperial exam,
serve in office,

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.010
By trapping me in this cage,

you ruined my future.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.790
Was it I who ruined you?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.440
When you were young,
you obsessed over the imperial exam,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.440
trying for years and never passing.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.120
Because of that, you fell into poverty

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.510
and were nearly beaten to death
by creditors.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.670
If Qingyu hadn't met you

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.720
would you be alive today?

The Storm Alliance is everyone's home,

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.630
never a prison!

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.720
If it's truly a home,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.840
there shouldn't be
so many unreasonable rules!

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.480
Every rule was established

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.160
for a reason.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.720
Without these rules,

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.030
this family would have fallen apart
long ago.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.230
If it's meant to fall apart,
why force it to stay together?

You saved Feng Suige.

it's for the good of the Storm Alliance,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.200

the pain

Why did you still save me?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.240
The last words I said to my father

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.480
were that

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.150
our father‑son bond

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.080

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.960
That was because I discovered

that my mother's death
was connected to him

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.360
and that my life

had been manipulated by him.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.100
I didn't kill him

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.600
only because he was my father.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.310
do you want to strictly follow
the alliance rules?

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.750
You want to leave too?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:52.720
[Storm Alliance]

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.880
I beg you to tell me the truth.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.620
Godfather,

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.360
I don't want to lie to you.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.830
I see.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
So it turns out

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.280
I've been the only one
wishing for this all along.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.860
Godfather!

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.070
Actually, Elder Lei

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.180
has his reasons.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.180
Many in the Storm Alliance

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.110
have never seen

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.680
the dangers of the outside world.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.010
They only long to go out,

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.010
but they don't appreciate

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.000
how precious this paradise is.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.310
A person won't know

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.170
the taste of pain until they fall.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.150
You've been through so much pain

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.370
that you've come to this realization.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.570
And haven't you as well?

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.560
The pain you've experienced

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.030
is greater and deeper

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.000
than mine.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.270
Today, you said

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.520
you're an orphan without a home.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.210
But now it's different.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.640
Now you have me.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.070
I will always be your family.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.540
We've been through so much together.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.080
Because I lost my memory

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.240
we went from enemies to lovers,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.140
and when you lost yours

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.640
we nearly went from lovers
back to enemies.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.110
But even so,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:25.550
you're still willing

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.590
to be my family.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.960
Thank you.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.380
After all we've been through,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.740
don't you feel bitter?

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.350
With you here,

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.920
how could I?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.330
I'll always be here.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.830
I'm sure after this,

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.640
Elder Lei won't be

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.440
so rigid in following the rules;

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.270
we should be able

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.200
to leave soon.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.380
Wherever you go in the future,

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.880
I will be with you.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.640
When we return to Susha,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.720
we'll reveal the truth.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.970
It's not just for revenge,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.960
but also to show the world

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.000
that Xiyang's brother isn't a villain

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.730
who killed his father and king.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.330
I'll send word to Xiyang

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.030
to tell her I'm alive.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.830
I can't bring her back

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.270
with peace of mind

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.670
until I've personally killed our enemies.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.400
Murong Zhong and his son

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.790
haven't found your whereabouts.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.450
They certainly won't give up.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.200
When we return to Yujing this time,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.530
it'll be full of danger.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.920
After leaving here,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:39.790
let's first find someone

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.480
to get a clear picture
of the current situation.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.740
This person is completely trustworthy.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.590
Okay.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.430
Killing Murong Zhong
and his son won't be easy.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.750
Why did you agree to that

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.730
so readily?

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:02.920
When my army

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.240
breaks through your Susha,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.550
taking their heads

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.550
won't be hard.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.590
You're still going to send troops
to attack Susha?

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.270
Our two countries
have finally achieved peace.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.960
What good would attacking Susha again

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.290
do for you?

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.310
What?

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.830
Now you suddenly care about

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.120
the people of Susha?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.270
I only agreed to help you kill them;

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.930
I never agreed to how I'd do it.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.850
I only want Murong Zhong and his son dead.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.120
I don't want innocent people to suffer.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.440
You're angry?

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.170
It doesn't matter.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.720
As long as I'm happy.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.640
Whether to send troops

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.110
isn't for you to decide, is it?

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.110
Isn't your mother

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.510
the real ruler of Jinxiu?

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.450
Dare you say that again?

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.210
Am I wrong?

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.200
Dare to make another bet with me?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.060
I'm listening.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.300
I bet your mother

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.550
doesn't care about your opinion at all.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.410
She sees me as a thorn in her side.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.690
She will find a way to get rid of me.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.200
Fine.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.460
I'll take that bet.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.310
In 15 minutes,

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.310
the Royal Guards will be back here.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.240
We must be quick.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.650
Your Highness,

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.270
the water's getting cold.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.270
You've been bathing for a long time.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.610
Shall I help you dress?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.330
No matter how long I bathe, it's no use.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.730
[Yujian Pavilion]

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.230
I won't get clean.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.840
[Yujian Pavilion]

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.310
Kneel!

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.340
Get out.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.800
You may leave.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.200
Yes.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.680
I killed the person who wanted to kill you

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.830
with my own hands.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.110
So?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.240
From now on,

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.950
no one in this palace will dare kill you.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.790
I won again,

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.160
didn't I?

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.750
[Storm Alliance]

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:49.400
[Storm Alliance]

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.310
Elder Lei,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.130
what are your plans for the future?

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.110
I...

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.210
I'm not going anywhere.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.880
I'll stay here.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.610
In case they come back,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.230
someone needs to be home.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.070
If I'm not mistaken,

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.480
you're also here to say goodbye.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.920
Yes.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.000
I saved you,

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.510
and you saved me.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.750
You and I

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.550
are even now.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.880
Since I gave you my word,

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.440
I'll do everything I can

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.640
to find out the truth.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.240
May I

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.080
ask you for one favor?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.350
Please speak.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.510
You're both capable people

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.310
who've seen all kinds of storms.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.110
If any member of the Storm Alliance

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.000
runs into trouble out there

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.910
and comes to you for help,

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.240
could you—

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.350
for my sake—

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.070
not let them go hungry or cold?

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.370
You can send them

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.110
back to me.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.310
Alright.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.000
I promise you.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.600
Of course, Elder Lei.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.040
Please rest assured.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.080
Lei Lie has agreed
to let them leave the mountain.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.190
I have more good news for you.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.310
From now on,

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.310
anyone who wants to leave
the Storm Alliance

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.440
can do so at any time.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.300
I'm here to say goodbye.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.110
Before I leave,

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.250
there's one more thing.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.430
I lost our bet, didn't I?

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.880
I'm giving you Zhengnian Villa.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.680
Who wants your stupid villa?

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.550
You said it yourself.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.550
No take-backs.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.390
Well...

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.750
a bet is a bet.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.280
I can't owe you anything.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.830
As long as it's within my power,

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.290
just tell me what you want.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.000
I want you to drink this.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.830
Mushroom?

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.350
Drink it.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.550
I've already had some.
What are you afraid of?

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.550
Once I drink this,

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.590
we're even, alright?

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.240
Yes, we'll be even.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.270
What is this?

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:13.030
A new medicine I developed.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.400
It dispels dampness.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.030
I...

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.270
How would I know?

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.350
Why is this...

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.160
dampness-dispelling medicine so strong?

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:36.680
I want you to drink it.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.110
You don't know?

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.270
And you made me drink it?

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.120
I'm dying of laughter.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.960
Your injuries are mostly healed,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.680
but they still need time to fully recover.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.640
This medicine can nourish the body
and restore your energy.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.170
Take 2 pills a day for 5 days,

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.170
and you should recover
about 70 to 80 percent.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.110
Thank you, Young Mistress Ling.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.480
What about you, Xueying?

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.880
What are your plans next?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.750
I just went to find my father

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:21.590
at Lady An's place.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.880
He left me a note

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.030
saying...

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.690
he went traveling with Lady An

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.440
and told me to go back

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.240
and look after Zhengnian Villa.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.110
Yixiao.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.610
Ning Fei.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.640
I prepared some dry rations

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.300
for you to eat on your journey.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.240
Thank you.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.640
Yes.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.440
Here.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.040
Thank you.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.320
Ning Fei has agreed

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.500
to return to Zhengnian Villa with me.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.210
That's good.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:52.720
You can look out for each other,

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.180
which puts my mind at ease.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.830
You must take care of yourselves.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.070
After I send Xueying back,

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.240
I'll come join you.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.310
Maybe I can be of some help.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.160
Okay.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.600
I'll thank you in advance.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.440
Why are you being so polite again?

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.100
I told you we're brothers now.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.750
This list names so many officials

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.960
to be promoted.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.510
[Li Boyong] [Zhang Ziyu]

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.160
Yes.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.110
The new emperor
has just ascended the throne,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.030
and state affairs are in disarray.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.290
All the departments are short of people.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.450
We really need to add more people.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.590
Did you draft this list?

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.820
I discussed it

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.790
with the other ministers at court.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.320
They had no objections.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.890
Once His Majesty approves it,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.100
I can send the appointments
to each department.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.200
Your Highness,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.920
you are truly devoted to Susha.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.720
You've reached the age

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.960
when you should be enjoying retirement
in your hometown.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.440
Yet you're still managing state affairs

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.200
for this widow and her orphaned son.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.980
I am truly moved.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.960
I only wish to dedicate myself fully

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.160
and help ease His Majesty's burdens.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.960
However,

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.830
selecting officials
is a matter of great importance.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.000
Let's wait until I have discussed it
with His Majesty

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.400
before making any decisions.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.350
Very well.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.420
I'll return to my residence

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.880
and await your news.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.760
By the way,

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.970
there's another matter

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.440
of utmost importance

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.030
that I must report to you and His Majesty

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.650
for a decision.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.680
Feng Suige has disappeared,

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.740
and we don't know if he's still alive.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.410
What did you say?

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.400
Isn't he already dead?

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.050
His body is missing.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.680
I'm afraid there might be
unexpected trouble.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.750
I was planning to wait until
the court stabilized

00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:59.830
before personally

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.870
investigating this matter,

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:03.920
but as I just said,

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.270
with all departments short of staff,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.380
I can't leave.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.620
Your Highness,

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.030
are you threatening me?

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.500
How could I?

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.719
Your Majesty, you once said

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.710
that our fates

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.670
are shared in glory and loss.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.590
I've never

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:28.670
forgotten that.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.000
I'll take my leave.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.360
Servants.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:46.800
Bring me

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.510
the list of consort candidates

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.920
prepared for His Majesty.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.630
Yes.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.679
[Murong Residence]

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.030
Father,

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.590
will the Empress Dowager

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.650
agree to that list?

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.710
She will.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.230
Most of the people

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.880
on that list

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.740
are our people.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.700
She didn't raise any objections?

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.530
She thinks
now that the situation is stable,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.370
she can abandon us.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.770
She wants to suppress our Murong family.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.440
Then I'll make her see

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.880
that if I could put her Feng Chengyang

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.620
on the throne,

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.150
I can just as easily

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.030
pull him down.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.960
Yao,

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.440
I've told you many times.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320
At this point,

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:39.880
there's

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.750
no turning back for us.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.510
Since we've come this far,

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.230
we might as well

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.280
go all the way.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.710
When the time is right,

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.320
I'll make you emperor too.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.070
Are you ready?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.300
Father,

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.340
for the Murong family,

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.070
I'll do whatever you say.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.630
A handful of people?

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.540
Aside from the Murong family,

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.150
the only one
who can mobilize the Imperial Guards

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.440
is my mother.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.190
Right?

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:25.840
I didn't say that.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.160
I don't know anything.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:29.070
I don't know anything!

and Grand Commander of Yongzhou.

There are other candidates
for consorts as well.

of military generals.

I've told you before.

I don't want to get married.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.670
Qi Zheng has military merits

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.280
and is a trusted aide of your grandfather.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.630
He will be on our side.

If your birth charts match,

In the future,

he'll not only be able to

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.400
rival Murong Zhong and his son,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.320
but also help you

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.960
secure your position on the throne.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.090
You talk about these things every day.

If you don't want to be manipulated,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.910
you must do as I say.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.030
Since I was a child,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.360
you've always taught me

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.420
to compete,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.680
to gain favor,

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.590
to please Father,

to inherit the throne,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.670
but you've never

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.880
asked me

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.230
what I actually want.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.110
You're already the Emperor of Susha.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.310
What more do you want?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.960
With your position

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.630
comes many obligations
beyond your control.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.100
Instead of wasting time

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.070
on useless thoughts,

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.430
you should focus on

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.520
how to be a good emperor.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.400
Mother, do you truly want me

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.530
to be a good emperor?

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.550
Of course.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.440
Why won't you

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.150
tell me the truth

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.110
behind my father's death?

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.070
You said

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.400
that my father

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.880
was killed by my brother.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.790
Is that really true?

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.320
For you,

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.550
I've sacrificed so much,

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.360
yet you dare question me?

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:31.840
Fine.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.630
From now on,

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.930
I will decide everything for you.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.630
I won't consult with you anymore,

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.630
and I don't care if you like it or not.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.050
I'll help you secure your throne.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.110
If you want to hate me,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:45.880
then hate me.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:58.360
This is the residence of Song Cheng,

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.510
a scout of the Feng Battalion.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.030
He's absolutely trustworthy.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.550
Let's find him first

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:04.150
to learn the current situation
in Yujing City.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.800
Be careful

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.000
not to be spotted
by Murong Zhong and his son.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.710
Be careful.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:10.930
Let's go.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.240
Lu Ke.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.760
Miss Yixiao?

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:50.970
Your Highness?

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.510
Yun Qing?

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.180
Your Highness.

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.800
Yun Qing.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:07.400
Your Highness.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.930
-Your Highness!
-Yun Fang.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:14.920
Are you alright?

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.450
I'm fine.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.920
Your Highness, please come in.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.330
Where are the other brothers?

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:29.720
[Song Cheng's Offering]

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.710
[In Memory of my friend Li Hu]
[In Memory of my friend Chen San]

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.000
[In Memory of my friend Gu Yu]
[In Memory of my friend Hound]

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.080
[In Memory of my friend Gu Yu]

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:56.370
[In Memory of my friend Hound]

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.120
[In Memory of my friend Gu Yu]
[In Memory of my friend Hound]

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:15.640
Alright!

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.190
They all say you committed treason

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.840
and died.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.500
I don't believe it.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.220
I'm a scout.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.510
I only believe

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.970
what I see with my own eyes.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.780
In my eyes, you're someone

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.440
who values loyalty and righteousness

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.240
and could never commit treason.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.510
You must have been framed.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.630
So I investigated in secret,

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.630
found

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.030
these brothers' bodies,

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.030
and secretly buried them.
