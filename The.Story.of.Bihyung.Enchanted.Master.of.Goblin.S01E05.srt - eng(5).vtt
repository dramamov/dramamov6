Keumbok.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.490
See you again.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.370
Sure.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.730
This is my first time
making a friend in Seoul.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.580
Not as a friend.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.300
What?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.680
I'm asking you out on a date.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.060
What?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.960
Dr. Ji?

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.820
There's a mark.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.500
Dr. Ji!

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.430
Are you okay?

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.270
What?

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.900
You're nothing but strength,
as always.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.920
Jigwi?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.150
Dr. Ji, a-are you okay?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.289
Your hand is bleeding.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.490
You probably scratched it when you fell.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.570
Go home and apply some medicine—

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.680
I'm fine.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.480
I've always known he's old-fashioned and cruel.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.590
Oh, right.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.020
You said you two were friends, right?

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.130
Friends?

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.479
Don't be fooled by him.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.190
Jigwi once

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.710
stabbed Bihyung in his chest.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.410
S-Stabbed?

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.050
Don't mess with Keumbok.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.550
Do you like him?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.990
Yes.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.500
What?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.050
No, it's not like that.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.970
What?

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.780
What?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.220
In that case, Keumbok, do you dislike me?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.320
No, that's not it.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.000
What he's asking is
if there's something special between us.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600
You...

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
are someone special to me, that's true.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.889
That's not it.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.380
What he means is someone
you really cherish

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.570
and is so special that
you'd risk your life for—

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.810
That's right!

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.270
I really cherish you,
and you're very special to me.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.380
Of course I'd risk my life for you.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.920
Huh?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.950
That's my first time hearing this...

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.970
Didn't you know?

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.510
It's been like this since I first met you.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.210
I'll borrow this.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.940
Well...

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.940
Let's talk about the things
we didn't get to next time.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.079
Keep in touch.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.470
What? Wait—

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.060
I must have lived for too long.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.660
He'd risk his life?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.800
What a pain.

Aren't you two close?

We used to be.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.900
Until he betrayed Bihyung.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.470
What did he do?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.050
Without Bihyung around,
I'm afraid I can't say much.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.500
But because of this, Bihyung had to endure
a lot of pain for a long time.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.620
Speaking of,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.060
what's this on your face?

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.110
I got it while catching a ghost.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.060
What?

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.520
You can catch ghosts?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.880
As expected of a sorcerer.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.900
That's amazing.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.930
Bihyung ordered me to do it.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.310
He said something about a kid
who's afraid of walking at night.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.830
Do you know who that kid is?

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.210
Kid?

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.200
Hey.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.290
Can I hold onto you?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.470
It's night, after all.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.210
Are you a kid? Why are you so scared?

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.630
You have my energy on you,
so you'll be fine for a while.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.380
Even so...

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.500
You're faster than me,
since you have long legs.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.900
Oh, that's...

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.930
Be quiet.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.230
Oh.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.240
It's safe in the neighborhood
at night, too.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.800
Just letting you know.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.210
Wash up and come out.

for dinner today.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.220
Really?

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.410
Then I'll have one more bowl.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.020
Are you okay?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.830
You haven't changed.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.040
Hello?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.790
I'm healthy, but I don't have any money.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.880
I'll buy insurance next time...

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.670
Oh, no!

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.030
I'm calling you after seeing your photo
on the Aspiring Actor Forum.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.300
What?

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.760
You're Ha Keumbok, right?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.680
Yes, that's me!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.250

-Ah!
-Ha Keumbok!

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.580
What should I do?

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.830
About what?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.240
I was chosen!

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.040
But why is your heart beating so fast?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.230
Are you sick?

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.060
Article 4.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.870
Article 4, Article 4!

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.450
Article 4 of the contract!

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.270
"Do not approach suddenly."

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.080
I'm really sorry.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.409
What happened?

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.100
Well...

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.950
-An agency?
-An agency?

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.320
I uploaded my photo
on the Aspiring Actors Forum,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.010
and this agency said that they liked it

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.230
and asked me to pay them a visit.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.950
You can convince people
with just one photo.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.640
You're amazing, Keumbok.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.760
It's nothing.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.770
Would you like to have a look?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.200
Here.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.300
Well...

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.210
Wow, that's amazing.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.020
Can I print this and hang it up
in a frame?

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.470
It's not quite at that level.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.250
At this level, I don't think
we need to work in the through the night.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.160
It should be able to repel ghosts.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.450
It has such a scary vibe.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.160
I haven't felt this much pressure
in a long time.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.710
Stop looking at it.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.870
I'm in this photo too though.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.640

Hyung, is there something wrong?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.440
Oh.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.540
No.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.250
You look much better in person
than in photos.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.840
You have fair skin

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.370
and bright eyes.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.830
Even so, you're not saying anything like
I'm handsome.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.750
He has high standards.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.820
He lives his life looking at me every day,

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.900
so it'd be weird
if he didn't have high standards.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.620
Bihyung is not my type.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.180
What?

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.930
Y-You have a type?

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.070
I have standards, too.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.410
I'm curious.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.230
What's your ideal type?

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.050
Someone ordinary.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.890
Pale skin

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.270
and full lips.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.850
With thin ankles, but is a fast runner.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.130
Wow, you're so picky.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.270
What?

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.870
Everyone has standards like that,
don't they?

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.230
Well, my ideal type is clear, too.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.740
You two haven't even dated before.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.520
That's not true.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.060
I was invited on a date recently—

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.730
When? Where? With whom?

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.180
Answer me with the 5Ws and 1H.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.800
But it sounded like a joke.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.160
I knew it.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.250
You're Ha Keumpoop, after all.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.230
What?

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.870
Gosh, I'm doomed.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.240
What?

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.000
Well...

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.740
The agency sent me the script
for the meeting in advance.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.440
The lines are all for romance scenes.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.040
What's wrong with that?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.850
You may find this unbelievable...

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.330
but I've never been in a relationship.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.960
Are you laughing?

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.830
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.130
Y-Y-You've gone crazy!

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.570
This is just the beginning.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.090
I won't forgive you.
I'm going to report you to the police.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.540
J-Just for this?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.200
To register our marriage.
[T/N: A pun on "reporting to the police"

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.690
It's cute.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.260
That won't do.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.380
This should be a charismatic confession
from a man like an injured lone wolf.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.810
Charismatic?

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.920
That's what I'm best at.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.670
Should I just kick them out?

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.670
H-Hyung, this is a bit...

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.540
Don't move. Stand at attention!

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.170
Huh?

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.170
Get a grip and stand at attention!

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.550
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.600
Are you not going to answer me?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.410
Y-You've gone crazy!

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.610
I'll show you what "crazy" really is.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.790
I won't forgive you.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.000
I'm going to report you to the police.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.660
To register our marriage.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.170
How was that?

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.240
Did your heart flutter?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.370
I feel like my heart is going to explode.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.190
Is this what charisma is like?

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.140
How can I do it like you?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.950
I didn't do anything special.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.040
It must be a talent of mine.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.620
I knew it.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.320
Then you must be very popular.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.430
Even as a man, my heart is pounding.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.880
No.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.990
I'm just like you.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.890
Huh? In what way?

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.040
Have you never dated before?

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.940
Since you were born?

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.490
There's no need for that.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.360
Who gets into a relationship
because it's a necessity?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.630
Then why do people do it?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.580
It happens when
you get curious about someone

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.610
and just keep wanting to see them.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.570
Huh?

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.060
Have you never met someone like that?

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.680
No matter how many times you see them,
you still miss them.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.740
Even when you're with them, you still
miss them. That's what people say.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.080
Some people say
it's like being struck by lightning.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.840
Wait...

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.290
So...

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.970
The feeling I felt
when you were shouting at me just now...

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.530
Can't you even tell the difference
between your heart fluttering and fear?

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.180
You can at least avoid a lightning strike.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.810
He's looking down on us
just because he's dated before.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.560
Looks like it'll be difficult
on our own.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.020
Gildal,
you're finally starting to realize—

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.520
Instead...

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.600
you can just teach him.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.540
What?

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.470
You're the only one with experience
between us.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.630
With dating.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.530
I love kimchi soup
and kimchi stew the most.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.420
As for snacks,
I like red bean porridge the most.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.230
This is made with precious,
self-farmed red beans my grandpa sent.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.430
You can't buy these at the supermarket.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.500
The rice balls are super soft,
aren't they?

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.880
It's 'cause they're handmade.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.160
I heard you're obsessed with red beans—
I mean—

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.880
I prepared some
because I heard you liked them.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.500
What do you think?

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.150
Well, I'll make do with this.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.930
That's great.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.440
What are you doing?

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.460
I heard that
if I want to audition for a movie,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.360
I need an agency.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.810
Please help me.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.170
Why should I?

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.650
Fine, then.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.560
I'll throw it away.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.050
W-Wait.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.780
Hey. Why are you trying so hard
just to be an actor?

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.810
I just want to keep the promise I made
with my parents when I was young.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.430
What?

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.710
I made a promise with them
before they passed away.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.880
When I become an actor,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.640
I'll make my debut in a movie
directed by their favorite director.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.670
Don't you hate them?

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.020
What?

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.700
They left first

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.940
and left you all alone.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.160
Well... I was still very young.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.210
[A rear-end accident
caused two deaths in a family.]

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.880
Grandpa.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.930
When are my parents coming?

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.020
Leaving such a young child all alone.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.130
What am I going to do...

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.180
[A rear-end accident
caused two deaths in a family.]

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.300
Keumbok...

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.690
And I never thought I was left behind.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.410
After all, we had so many good memories.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.410
If we only remember
the people we cherish with sadness,

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.470
it would be so difficult.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.410
Besides, I still have Grandpa by my side.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.400
Ha Keumdong.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.610
What can I do for you?

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.310
Is it good?

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.040
Yes.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.590
That kind of feeling
where you're curious and you miss them.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.110
[Dr. Jigwi:
What are you doing?]

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.820
What are you doing?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:53.920
[Dr. Jigwi:
I miss you.]

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.760
I miss you.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.820
In other words,
Jigwi wants to date Keumbok.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.580
But to Bihyung, Jigwi is...

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.000
-Bihyung, is your stomach feeling better?
-Where is Keumpoop?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.320
He said he went to work.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.380
-I was invited on a date recently—
-What?

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.040
When? Where? With whom?

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.900
Answer me with the 5Ws and 1H.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.590
If this continues,
and they fight like they did before...

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.680
I have to stop this!

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.600
You're really annoying.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.640
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.100
What do you think?

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.030
You're so annoying.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.170
Don't you have any other characters?

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.310
This won't work.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.370
I don't...

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.610
Why does this character want to marry her
when he finds her so annoying?

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.780
That's because
he can't recognize his feelings.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.780
What do you mean?

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.480
If he doesn't even know
what he's feeling,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.520
why would he confess his love?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.610
Are you stupid?

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.340
Darn it.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.920
You're worried about how you feel,
but you can't ask them.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.200
Yet, you want to keep them by your side.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.180
But then you're in a dilemma.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.000
Then you'd raise your voice
'cause you're scared.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.030
Scared? This man is way scarier.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.160
He's a gangster boss!

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.760
That identity means nothing.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.970
This man

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.000
would rather be stabbed
than be rejected.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.070
What does that mean?

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.440
It's the same in the real world, too.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.120
It's not like he's a coward.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.280
He is a coward.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.170
A very timid

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.590
scaredy-cat.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.250
Then he's just an idiot.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.150
He is an idiot, that's right.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.480
Intimidated by his own emotions.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.500
I'm so sad.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.530
No, or do I feel a little suffocated?

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.760
Can you read this man's lines for me?

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.750
Why?

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.120
I think I need to hear you say it
to understand.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.260
Ha Keumpoop, you're really getting
the most out of your red bean porridge.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.140
You're really annoying.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.670
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.870
I can't tell if this is a confession
or a threat.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.450
Who are you calling a kid?

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.500
Are you going to keep making me
conscious of you?

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.880
I found it!

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.080
[Ha Keumbok]
