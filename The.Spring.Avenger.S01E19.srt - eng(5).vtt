00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.610
What are you doing here?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.170
I have nothing to say to you.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.560
Akiyama.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.840
You don't have to

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.840
to be so cold-hearted.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.200
I know

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.720
for me.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.120
because of me.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.440
Mr. Kang, you said

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.400
the game of adults.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.880
Don't take it seriously.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600
Now you're in the game.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.400
It's true.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.500
It's a bit funny, isn't it?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.800
Yes.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.850
I did take it seriously.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.600
Because we both love each other.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.960
Akiyama, I...

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.759
Clean it up and go.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.000
Don't dirty my place.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.960
You want me to leave?

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.100
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.920
Okay.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.539
How about this?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.000
Doesn't Mr. Mu care?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.240
What do you want?

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.920
Aren't you tired of playing?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.920
Why do you care about my life?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.160
Fine.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.289
Are you threatening me with your life?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.640
Akiyama!

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.400
Let go!

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.280
Akiyama!

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.880
Let go.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.640
Kang Chunu.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.640
Are you crazy?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.480
Am I crazy?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.200
You're the crazy one.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.079
Mu Qiu Shan.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.200
In order to save me,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.680
to save me.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.120
You're the crazy one.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.450
You're crazier than me.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.810
Why aren't you resting?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.170
Where are you going?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.680
I'm in a bad mood.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.640
Go out for a walk.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.840
This is...

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.840
The money inside

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.450
is enough for you to live without worries for a while.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.280
It's my compensation.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.480
I'm rich now.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.440
A child who wasn't born

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.720
for so much money.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.760
It's worth it.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.320
Thank you.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.240
Meng,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.200
Your wound will get infected

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.520
you'll get inflamed.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.400
It's okay.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.130
It's good to have a scar.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.160
Take it

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.360
the witness of our love.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.240
Why didn't I know

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.079
you are so glib-tongued.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.720
Maybe

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.120
I didn't meet you.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.800
No one stimulates my glib tongue

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.200
Talent of sweet words

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.440
Did I hurt your wound?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.960
Then

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
make it up to me?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.570
You didn't kiss me enough just now.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.920
No.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.320
Is it enough?

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.240
It's a little bit of water

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.080
I'm quite satisfied.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.680
What are you going to do

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.010
what are you going to do?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.600
Do you need my help?

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.240
Continue to

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.760
You just need to be humble.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.880
Don't worry about anything else.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.160
When the time is right,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.320
when the time is right.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.000
Okay.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.520
Are you stupid?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.640
It's time for you to show up.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.120
You did it twice this time.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.680
Add another 200 yuan.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.760
What?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.800
You have to add me.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.320
Screw you!

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.040
You bitch!

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.240
You always ask for money.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.800
You're living a miserable life.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.130
Why don't you ask your daughter for money?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.080
My daughter.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.760
Girl.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.160
She's alive.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.720
She's alive.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.640
but also very well.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.760
Wearing this to the awards ceremony.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.040
Do I look good?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.800
Yes.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.760
Akiyama will go with me.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.120
Is he here?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.820
He's waiting outside.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.760
Qiushan!

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.560
Beauty

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.440
It's really a girl.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.800
My dear daughter.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.760
You're really something now.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.000
You got the wrong person.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.880
Who is your daughter?

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.520
Girl

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.760
I'm your mom.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.280
I'm not mistaken.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.040
Look at his face.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.280
It's exactly the same as when I was young.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.480
I have a photo.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.960
Look.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.760
Cry.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.720
All you do is cry.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.680
You jinx.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.520
You cried

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.760
all because of you.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.520
Get lost.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.680
Come back.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.920
Don't tear it.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.720
Crazy.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.480
Meng!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.480
Kick her out.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.000
I'm really your mother, Miss Nian.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.160
I'm your mom.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.200
Akiyama!

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.560
Let's go.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560
Or we'll be late

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.600
I'll be late.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.330
She's really your mom. Stop it.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.000
My mom died a long time ago.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.800
She must be crazy.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.140
[I'm jealous.]

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.200
You're so successful now.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.000
you won't know your real mother.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.440
Wait and see.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.080
Next, we're going to present

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.600
Best New Artist Award.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.720
The winner is Miss Xia Nian.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.780
Congratulations.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.200
Next is

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.840
the grand prize.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.560
The Best Actress.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200
The winner is

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.240
In the movie "Kind She",

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.800
in the movie "Kind She".

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.100
Congratulations.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.200
Gu Nian.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.080
Let's welcome the actor.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.400
Meanwhile, let's welcome the award presenter

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.240
to present the award for Miss Gu Nian.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.040
Welcome.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.400
Congratulations, Miss Gu Nian.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.640
Why are you here?

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.160
To give you a surprise.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.560
What do you want?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.720
Be patient.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.240
You'll know later.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.400
Are you sure

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.480
is true, right?

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.120
Yes.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.900
[I'm going to take care of Gu Nian.] Okay.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.840
Not only that,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.800
that she's marrying Mu Qiu Shan,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.180
I need to know more about her actions.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.360
more

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.880
the things

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.440
that Mu Qiushan thought

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.500
that she can't act.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.400
So,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.880
A Flying Horse Best Actress?

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.090
Flying Horse Best Actress?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.600
Since she loves fame so much,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
let’s make her more famous.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.320
Miss Gu,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.000
please give your speech.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.440
Hello.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.680
I'm Gu Nian.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.640
I'm really happy today

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.800
to get this award.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.240
Without my family,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.680
without my family.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.400
I want to thank my grandpa.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.360
What a pity.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.560
he can't see this.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.200
I also want to thank my fiancé.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.360
Mu Qiushan.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.370
After grandpa passed away,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.200
he was by my side.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.480
Without him,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.240
I wouldn’t be in a good mood.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.960
Miss Gu may be too happy today.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.760
I forgot to thank someone.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.200
is

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.520
her biological mother.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.520
She's here. She's here.
