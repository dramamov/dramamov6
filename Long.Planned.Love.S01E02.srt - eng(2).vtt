00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.840
Miss Jian,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.230
Mr. Zhou asked me to bring you medicine.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.000
Please thank him for me.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.680
(Pan Yu, Zhou Tingyan's assistant)

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.520
Miss Jian.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.510
There's something...

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.240
Go ahead.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.740
Vice President Jian from Changsheng Group

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620
has taken an interest in Mr. Zhou.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.060
(Jian Wenqian)

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.300
(has feelings for Zhou Tingyan.)

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.460
So, you mean...

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.740
You hope I can help

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.220
to make Jian Wenqian give up.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.660
Then I'll trouble you, Miss Jian.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.220
It's no trouble.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.500
How is it?

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.100
Is Little Princess set on canceling it?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.860
What about Meng Tang?

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.460
Why bring her up?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.820
On a business trip.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.380
Give Meng Tang a call.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.140
Ask if she's heard about
what happened tonight.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.500
If she knows,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.140
she'll keep Jian Cheng company.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.500
If she doesn't know,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.320
then tell her and let her

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.300
stay by Cheng's side.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.710
Not calling her.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.620
She got on my nerves.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.020
I finally got a bit of breathing space.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.620
She's too clingy.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.780
Make the call.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.260
I'll let you win.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.100
Why'd you assume I wanted

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500
to win this round?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.880
Qin Zhuo.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.940
I just got off the plane.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.100
I've got something urgent.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.860
If it's not important, I'm hanging up.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.640
You're back here?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.940
Cheng's in a bad mood today.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.720
I came back for her.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.290
I'll catch the earliest flight tomorrow.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.380
Spend some real time with her.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.580
I'll have someone else handle your work.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.060
You stay here.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.940
Why do I get the feeling

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.820
you care a lot about Jian Cheng?

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.780
Because

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.220
she once saved my life.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.540
Your life-saver.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.540
If I were her,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.780
I'd make you marry me.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.260
If you marry President Zhou,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.780
you'll become Yufeng's elder.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.100
He'll have to greet you as Auntie.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.100
You can deal with him however you want.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.460
Second,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.060
you'll have the strongest backing
in Jiangyu.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.100
No one will dare mess with you again.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.100
Third, you'll take away the man
Jian Wenqian likes.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.340
No revenge feels better than that.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500
Your parents won't dare
show favoritism again.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.780
So,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.700
I thought after you canceled the wedding,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.620
you'd use that lifesaving debt
to make him marry you.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.260
I won't bother you anymore.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.900
(Marry Zhou Tingyan...)

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.340
President Zhou.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.500
Did she get the med?

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.020
Yes.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.300
Miss Jian asked me to thank you.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.580
I gave Miss Jian a hint
as you told me.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.460
But she thought I was joking.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.020
See you at the office at 8 am.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.540
(Zhou Yufeng)
Bring Jiang Yawei along.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.340
President Zhou.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.500
Are you really going to marry Miss Jian?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.140
Uncle Zhou.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.580
Did Jian Cheng complain to you?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.680
Did she talk behind Yawei's back?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.660
I've already agreed to marry her.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.940
What more does she want from me?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.100
Zhou Yufeng.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.140
Drop the act.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.300
You know why you won't

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.820
call off the engagement.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.420
Jian Cheng only wants
to end it with you.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.820
She mentioned no one else.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.700
Why are you feeling guilty?

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.260
Stop shifting the blame onto others.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.820
Is that what you call being a man?

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.560
End the engagement

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.840
and you'll get 2% of the shares.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.820
If not,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.660
transfer all your shares to Jian Cheng

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.140
as compensation.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.660
It's your choice.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.660
Uncle Zhou.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.980
Don't worry.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.180
I'll handle this properly.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.540
Eight am tomorrow, don't be late.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.860
Or you'll have to face the consequences.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.180
(I need to calm Uncle Zhou first.)

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.180
(Cao Ying, Zhou Yufeng's mother)

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.620
Calling off the engagement...

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.460
(After what happened at Jian Cheng,)

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.220
(she's still trying
to cling to our family.)

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.500
(Good riddance.)

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.540
(Qianyi Group)

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.650
Sir, they've arrived.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.860
Uncle Zhou.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.500
President Zhou.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.660
Uncle Zhou.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.820
I promised to marry Jian Cheng.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.340
I'm not going back on my word.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.940
Do you not get what I'm saying?

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.780
Uncle Zhou.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.140
Two percent of the shares

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.020
were for you agreeing to marry Jian Cheng.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.860
I gave them to you.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.460
Now she wants to call it off.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.300
Don't worry.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.340
I'm not taking back the shares.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.340
But for the reason we tell outsiders

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.860
and the criticism,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.300
you'll take it.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.580
President Zhou...

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.420
What?

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.140
You made such a scene at the banquet.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.140
Love being the center of attention?

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.420
President Zhou,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.260
did Jian Cheng tell you something?

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.100
Next week,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.820
at Qin Zhuo's birthday banquet,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.420
you'll apologize to Jian Cheng.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.580
Then I need you to admit

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.240
it was you who came between them.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.580
That's why Jian Cheng called it off

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.500
and let you be together.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.180
Uncle Zhou,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.820
doing this will ruin Yawei.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.020
Who's ruining who, huh?

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.140
You haven't called off the engagement,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.900
and she's actually willing to interfere.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.340
Serves she right.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.060
Uncle Zhou.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.620
You owe Jian Cheng a life debt to repay.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.340
Don't drag me in.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.260
I don't owe you anything.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.340
You want me to end it.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.300
Fine, I'll call it off.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.700
I'll even give up my shares.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.420
Oh, right.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.860
You want an apology too?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580
I can apologize.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.460
But only if you

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.700
agree to let me marry Yawei.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.060
So you want to marry her?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.420
Yes.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.180
Alright.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.740
Uncle Zhou.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.820
Are you being serious?

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.020
Two conditions.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.940
First,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.740
cash out the apartment meant
for you and Jian Cheng.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.700
And transfer your two shop units to her.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.660
Second,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.700
you must apologize publicly.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.660
Agree to these two things

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.980
and you can

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.540
marry her.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.340
Your pride or your marriage?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.220
You decide.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.780
This is your only chance.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.900
Miss it and it's gone.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.740
Assistant Pan.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.860
What does he mean by that?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.580
One moment Miss Jian is getting engaged.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.600
Next she's calling it off.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.340
Even if it's repaying a favor,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.580
there should be a limit.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.160
President Zhou...

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.700
Guess he's just tired of it.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.850
Since you aren't worried about trouble,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.180
why bother helping them out?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.880
If Yufeng wants to be laughed at

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.300
and Jiang Yawei insists
on jumping into the mess,

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.180
why not just let them be?

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.980
(Most importantly,)

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.380
(it cut off Jian Cheng's path to regret.)

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.500
(Only then can she keep moving forward.)

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.740
Miss Jian.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.820
Assistant Pan.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.580
Is Uncle Zhou free right now?

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.820
Have her come over.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.860
What?

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.980
You want Zhou Tingyan to marry you?

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.180
Exactly.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.000
(Meng Tang, Jian Cheng's bestie)
Pan Yu gave me the chance.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.140
I might as well take it.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.740
Who knows, it could work out.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.740
Uncle Zhou.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.260
The third wish.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.380
You already figured it out?

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.620
Uncle Zhou.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.170
Do you need a wife?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.820
Why?

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.790
You want to set me up?

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.260
No.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.700
What I mean is...

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.780
if you actually need a wife,

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.380
how about me?

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.780
I promised Zhou Yufeng
he could marry Jiang Yawei.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.940
I know you know that.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.060
Is this to get back at him?

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.540
No.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.980
Zhou Yufeng.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.660
He doesn't care about me.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.900
It wouldn't matter to him who I marry.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.100
So,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.540
why do you want to marry me?

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.340
If I could become his aunt-in-law,

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.540
that would get under his skin.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.700
I'll make another wish.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.060
I...

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.180
What is your new wish?

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.660
The wedding apartment with Yufeng.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.820
Can you get him to sell it?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.220
I already asked him to sell it.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.140
Then I'll choose another.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.510
Let's stick with the first one.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.600
♪If the star path leads
to the light-year's end♪

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.700
I told you before.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.420
Any request you make, I'll agree to.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.820
You want the title of Mrs. Zhou.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.980
I'll give it to you.
