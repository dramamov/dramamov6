[In Reverence, Song Cheng]

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.920
[Memorial Tablet of My Friend, Li Hu]
[Memorial Tablet of My Friend, Chen San]

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.220
The First Prince I knew

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.850
was a loyal and righteous man.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.070
[Memorial Tablet of My Friend, Gu Yu]
[Memorial Tablet of My Friend, Hound]

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.270
There's no way you'd ever plot treason.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.229
You must have been framed.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.370
So I secretly investigated

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.480
and found

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.010
the bodies of our brothers.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.710
I buried them quietly.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.000
[Memorial Tablet of My Friend, Gu Yu]
[Memorial Tablet of My Friend, Hound]

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.030
Before we avenge them,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.630
we have to swallow

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.290
all the tears and bitterness.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.470
Our brothers are
still watching us from above.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.280
Your Highness,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.540
leave Murong Jie to me.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.079
I swear

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.810
I'll take his damn head myself!

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.150
Good.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.400
The Murong father and son
framed Feng Suige.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.860
They won't spare
the Feng Battalion either.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.490
The Feng Battalion

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.190
has already been controlled by Murong Yao.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.120
Impossible.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.590
Everyone in the Feng Battalion
has fought side by side with us.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.520
They'd never betray His Highness.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.890
Anyone who refused to yield to Murong Yao

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.280
was killed by him.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.280
I pledged my loyalty to Your Highness

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.870
and refused to serve under Murong Yao,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.680
so I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.560
retired early.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680
Now I'm just a commoner.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.450
Your Highness,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.360
we've been

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.420
searching for you.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.950
Such a huge upheaval in Susha

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.480
must have raised suspicions.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.360
The entire court

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.360
is controlled by the Murong family.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.190
No one dares to question this matter.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.110
However, during my investigation,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.710
I found someone

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.310
secretly looking into this.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.280
It's Shen Wu,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.840
the Minister of Rites.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.020
Shen Wu is an opportunist.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.590
He definitely didn't want
to investigate it himself.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.650
Someone must be pulling his strings.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.910
The Murong father and son
and Empress Zhuang

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.990
all know the truth.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.030
They're too busy concealing it

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.960
to investigate.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.680
So,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.730
there's only one person

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.960
with such power and the desire

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960
to know the truth.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.560
Chengyang.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.090
Song Cheng,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.910
I want to meet Shen Wu.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.890
Can you help me?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.020
No problem.

Mother, you've come at a good time.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.010
The lamb chop from Susha

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.590
is incredibly delicious.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.670
Everyone out!

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.020
-Yes.
-Yes.

Stop.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.160
Mother, just say what you want to say.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.820
If they dare to breathe a word,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.690
just kill them.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.850
I know why you've come, Mother.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.840
Bring it here.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.560
Mother, can you tell

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.760
whose hamlet this is?

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.390
It's Liang Pin's.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.060
How could you kill him?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.140
I am the Emperor.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.680
What's wrong with me killing Liang Pin?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.270
He was the Imperial Military Commander!

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.200
What commander?

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.010
Wasn't he just your dog?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.390
Mother,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.480
you tried to kill my woman.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.540
So what if I killed your dog in return?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.490
He was not even as good as a dog.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.490
Calling him that

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.300
insults dogs.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.160
Princess Xiyang arrives!

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.580
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

Come.

This is the lamb chop from Susha—

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.720
quite delicious.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.650
I'll cut a piece for you myself.

Your Majesty,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.220
why are you protecting this bitch

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.180
like this?

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.720
Here.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800
How does it taste?

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.070
It seems you're determined

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.390
to go against me.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.510
Great.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.370
My Jingyan has grown up.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.090
You raised me well, Mother.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.220
How about this?

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.410
Go enjoy your golden years

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.290
and stay out of state affairs.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.730
I wouldn't dare.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.100
I'm afraid you'll ruin Jinxiu

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.110
for this cheap Susha woman.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.560
Mother, you really care about Jinxiu.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.050
But this is my kingdom.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.240
I can ruin it however I want!

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.190
You always say I'm incompetent,

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.070
but that's because
you can't see my talent.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.930
What I'm good at

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.490
isn't ruling a kingdom.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.950
It's destroying one.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.950
Liang Pin was the first

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.370
to dare kill my woman.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.800
I hope

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.200
he's the last.

Please take care of your health.

If you're truly a filial son,

get rid of Feng Xiyang for me.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.740
Whether you're truly filial as a son,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.480
we'll see by what you do.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.890
I can't stand

[Linfang Hall]

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.030
Princess, you're here all alone.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.720
You must be troubled and have come here

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.780
to clear your mind.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.960
Prince of Zhennan,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.160
you must hate my guts.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.240
All this concern

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.270
and polite talk…

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.130
what are you plotting now?

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.570
Why would I hate you?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.070
There's no one else here.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.900
Why ask what you already know?

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.310
Bai Shouzhuo died because of me.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.290
Shouldn't you hate me?

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.910
Why do I see

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.500
hostility in your eyes?

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.610
The eyes see what the mind thinks.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.840
What's on your mind

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.530
is what you see with your eyes.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.880
If you view me as an enemy,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.930
of course you'll sense hostility.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.070
You make a good point.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.960
But tell me,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.840
how have we ended up

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.210
as enemies?

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.850
You forgot?

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.170
The first time we met,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.150
we were already enemies.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.160
Thank you for reminding me.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.230
Since

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480
we've been enemies all along,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.310
I feel much better.

Are you here to kill me?

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.120
Yes.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.040
Then why haven't you done it yet?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.530
Because I still owe you a favor.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.060
Someone like you

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.860
actually cares about that?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.250
Because I'm hypocritical enough.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.240
That's actually

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.960
the most honest thing I've heard from you.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.600
So,

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.470
since I'm being honest for once,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.720
let me give you

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.300
one last piece of advice.

Leave this place.

don't tell me
you want me to turn back now?

Feng Xiyang,

no one in this world

understands what you're thinking

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.450
better than I do.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.510
Because I've walked every step

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.040
of the path you're walking.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.880
Your facade,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.610
your despair,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.920
and your desperate gamble—
I understand them all.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.710
After my father died,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.150
I just wanted to survive.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.200
Is it wrong for someone
to just want to live?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.080
But if I wanted to survive,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.210
I had to depend on the Empress Dowager—

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.200
just like how you are

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.460
using Xia Jingyan now.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.710
Eventually,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.670
driven by despair and revenge,

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.330
you'll follow in my footsteps

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.480
and become like me.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.020
I've never been a good person,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.800
but you are

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.610
the kindest person I've ever met.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.870
Let go of all this.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.150
Let go of revenge.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.350
Live a peaceful life.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.740
It's not too late.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.200
Xia Jingshi,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.200
I've already fallen into the abyss,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.770
and only now do you offer help.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.730
I won't be grateful for this.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.870
I only find it even more disgusting!

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.000
You might as well not help me at all.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.620
Just be the villain you are.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.550
You've made me what I am today,

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.240
and now you want to save me?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.720
You think I'm pitiful, don't you?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.250
I don't need your sympathy!

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.800
You don't deserve it!

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.810
Since that's the case,

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.680
so be it.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:13.750
Princess Xiyang,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.840
His Majesty said you've been gone
for a while picking flowers,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.370
so he sent me to check on you.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.760
An enemy is an enemy.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.380
Next time, don't pretend to be concerned

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.200
or convince me to turn back.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.240
You just think killing me

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.100
would interfere with your plans.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.130
Xia Jingshi,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.840
no one knows better than I do

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.270
what's on your mind

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.500
in this very moment.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.120
What's wrong with you?

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.490
Do you still want this job?

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.790
First Prince?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.210
You…

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.400
you're still alive.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.010
I didn't see anything.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.120
I didn't see anything.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.810
I know nothing!

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.800
You know nothing?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720
Then there's no need for you to live.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.940
I'm still useful.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.380
I'm still useful!

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.970
Your Highness, please don't kill me.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.600
What do you need me to do?

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.390
I will do whatever you ask.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.390
[Personal Guards: Li Jianxin,
Zhao Yunhai, Zhang Moying]

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.650
Just as you predicted,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.670
the Empress Dowager

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.510
really did plant spies among Xia Jingyan's

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.510
personal guards.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.080
That's just how she is.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.320
She has to

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.240
have everything

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.750
under her control.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.190
The Royal Guards
protect the imperial palace.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.320
Military Commander Liang Pin was her man.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.650
The personal guards protect Xia Jingyan.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.840
So naturally,
she has her people there too.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.700
She wants to control everything.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.770
Yet Your Highness has seen through it all.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.650
They're digging their own grave.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.720
Where did this list come from?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.490
Wang Encheng provided it.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.720
Among the personal guards,

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.480
there's a team leader named Zhang Ming.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.330
He's close to Wang Encheng.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.750
[Personal Guards: Zhu Tieyi,
Chen Shuangjian, Zhong Jingsong]

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.200
Zhang Ming told him in private

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.000
that these particular personal guards

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.080
had reported secretly

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.810
to the Empress Dowager before.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.370
Does Zhang Ming know

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.080
Wang Encheng is

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.380
investigating for us?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.760
Rest assured.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.000
Wang Encheng is tight-lipped.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.400
He's never mentioned his connection to us.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.220
Your Highness,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.000
did you request this list

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.310
because you

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.510
already have a plan?

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.800
This is a gift for Xia Jingyan.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.870
There's already a rift between Xia Jingyan
and the Empress Dowager,

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.000
but they haven't

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.530
completely fallen out yet.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.030
So I'm going to

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.100
fan the flames.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.520
Find a way

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.570
to get this list to Xia Jingyan.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.710
Just make sure

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.390
no one realizes

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.220
it's from us.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.080
Yes.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.690
What did you say?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.330
I really did

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.970
meet with the First Prince.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.390
He wishes to meet with you in private.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.470
Given the urgency,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.360
I had no choice

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.660
but to agree

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.260
to relay the message to you first.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.000
Please forgive me.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.360
You did well.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.590
Your Majesty,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.210
are you going to meet him?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.080
Of course.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.490
Why wouldn't I?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.760
You're my confidant.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.540
Speak freely.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.589
Then, allow me to be frank.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.720
Prime Minister Zhuang died

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.250
at the First Prince's hand.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:09.000
If that

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.310
hadn't happened,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440
the throne

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.050
would have

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:14.760
belonged to him.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.770
I've spoken out of turn.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.550
Please forgive me.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.250
You've only spoken the truth.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:25.550
There's nothing to forgive.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.000
Get up.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.320
But I believe

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.430
Suige

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.760
would never harm me.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.510
Go make arrangements immediately.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.710
I'll set out tonight.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.960
But you must

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.030
not tell anyone.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.890
This must remain secret,

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.640
especially from my mother.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.960
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.470
Minister Shen.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.890
I've been watching you for some time.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.920
You met His Majesty

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.450
in private again and again.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.010
You seem to be in a hurry.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.540
What is it about?

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.340
Just official business.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.240
You understand

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.470
which way the wind blows.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.860
Don't be misled into choosing

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.720
the wrong side.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.440
I'm giving you one last chance

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.760
to tell the truth.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.350
What?

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.180
It's absolutely true.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.350
The men we placed

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.080
among the personal guards

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.560
were just executed by His Majesty's order.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.070
How did His Majesty discover them?

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.810
I secretly looked into it.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.600
It's said that

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.240
after His Majesty
killed Military Commander Liang,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.220
he searched his residence

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.330
and found that list.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.350
Nonsense!

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.350
Liang Pin had nothing
to do with the personal guards.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.400
How would he know?

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.070
Liang Pin is now dead.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.500
Dead men tell no tales.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.350
No one will ever know

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.590
where that list really came from.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.530
I doubt

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.130
His Majesty had any real evidence,

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.460
but he had them executed all the same.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.270
When does His Majesty

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.200
ever need evidence to kill anyone?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.010
Summon the Prince of Zhennan to see me.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.240
Yes.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.090
[Yangyue Palace, Yuxiu Palace,
Hehuan Hall]

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.170
Are you troubled by something?

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.680
Come, come.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.550
I thought all you did was play around

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.410
without a care for state affairs.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.000
But you're

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.730
actually diligent sometimes.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.500
State affairs?

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.000
What state affairs?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.590
If I had to

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.200
handle state affairs myself,

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:50.920
then what's the point

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.650
of paying all those officials?

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.510
Come.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.270
Sit.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.040
Look at this.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.440
[Jiyue Hall, Linhua Palace,
Pixiang Hall, Shuhua Palace]

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.240
I ordered the palace staff

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.590
to pick some new residences for you:

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.120
Jiyue Hall, Linhua Palace,
and Pixiang Hall.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.750
I have no idea

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.210
which one you'd prefer.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.450
How about this?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.500
You take a look.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.120
Choose whichever you like.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.510
So this is what you were studying?

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.110
Yes.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.850
If you like them all,

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.160
I'll give them all to you.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.200
I guess a few

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:18.920
pedantic old officials

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920
will object.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.090
But don't worry.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440
Whoever dares to object,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.590
I'll have them beheaded.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.190
I don't need a new residence.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.100
I can just stay in the Mirror Room.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.590
The Mirror Room is too shabby.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:30.790
Just a place to sleep!

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.000
If you ask me,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
the Mirror Room is no different

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.330
from all these palaces.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.070
Feng Xiyang!

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.680
I have so many palaces,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.340
and you don't like any of them?

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.500
If you continue to be so unappreciative…

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.750
I'll build you a new palace.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.610
How about that?

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.420
Xia Jingyan,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.680
instead of thinking about these things,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.350
why don't you help me figure out

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.410
how to kill the Murong father and son?

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.090
What's the rush?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.240
Once they're killed

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.590
and you get your revenge,

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.820
you'll want to leave.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.410
You want to go back on your word?

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.720
You're the ruler of a kingdom.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.640
A king's word is law.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.570
You can't break your promise to me!

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.340
I am a ruler, that's true,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.570
but I'm also a man.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.570
Isn't it normal for a man

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.680
to lie to a woman?

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.200
You…

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:20.920
Wait, wait.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.000
Don't get upset.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.700
I was just joking with you.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.240
Alright.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.270
I never lie to women,

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.810
especially not to you.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.530
It was you who used that...

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.510
that bet

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.160
to stop me from attacking Susha.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.350
You have to give me some time

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.680
to come up with a new plan

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.650
to kill the Murong father and son.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.200
Alright. Be patient.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.780
You just want me to stay.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.720
You want this imperial palace

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.800
to become my cage!

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.720
Your cage?

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440
What a great idea!

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.050
Why didn't I think of that?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.680
I'll immediately

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.640
build you a new palace

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.550
that looks like a cage!

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.280
You're sick!

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.310
Don't go yet!

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.830
I have a gift for you.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.950
[Fuxin Pavilion]

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.050
I asked you to kill the Princess of Susha,

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.860
yet you still haven't done it.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.390
You've really let me down.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.400
Forgive me, Mother.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.040
His Majesty has

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.400
assigned personal guards

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.260
to protect her.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.000
I really haven't found the chance.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:21.820
Mother,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.610
could you temporarily

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.820
remove the personal guards

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.110
so that I can…

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.100
I only gave you this one task,

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.350
and you still need my help?

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.570
Calm down, Mother.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.420
Forgive my incompetence.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.200
Forget it.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960
You have the will but lack the means.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.640
After all, this is

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.970
not your Pingling City.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.100
It's Mother's Pingling City.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.010
I was away for so many years

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.240
guarding Pingling for you.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.770
All land under heaven
belongs to the Emperor.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.130
It's His Majesty's Pingling City.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.240
You weren't guarding it for me.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.070
Don't say such foolish words

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.110
ever again.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.110
Get up.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.000
His Majesty has become

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.750
increasingly difficult to understand.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.880
Officials proposed attacking Susha,

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.200
but he refused.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.680
It must be Feng Xiyang interfering.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.030
I planned to restore

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.360
your military command,

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.630
but it keeps getting postponed.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.560
After all these years outside,

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.200
being able to return

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.130
and serve you with filial devotion

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.750
isn't such a bad thing.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.590
Rather than a filial son,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.400
what I truly need

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.930
is the Prince of Zhennan
who lets me rest easy.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.000
Mother, you mean...

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.880
You fool,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.140
you're in real danger
without realizing it.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.110
His Majesty has always wanted you dead.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.970
In the past, I could hold him back,

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.240
but now,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.470
with Feng Xiyang messing with his mind,

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.400
he barely even

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.130
acknowledges me as his mother.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.110
If he ever insists on killing you,

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.640
I may not be able to stop him.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.900
Please enlighten me, Mother.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:09.720
How can I protect myself?

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.200
Right now,
with peace between the two kingdoms,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.660
he thinks you're useless.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.100
But when war breaks out,
it'll be different.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.350
That's why Feng Xiyang must die,

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.030
and Susa must be attacked.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.160
However, I don't want

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.030
this matter

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.990
to create a rift
between His Majesty and me.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.110
I understand.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.350
I'll first kill Feng Xiyang

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.920
and frame Susha for it.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.510
Then I'll provoke His Majesty

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.240
into waging war against Susha.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.270
Since I can't go after

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.070
Feng Xiyang in the palace,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.780
I might as well…

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.030
try something outside.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.590
How could His Majesty

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.480
possibly let her leave the palace?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.280
The opportunity will come soon.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.110
Mother,

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.330
the Qianqiu Festival is approaching.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.100
Will your brother stand with you?

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.480
Chengyang and I

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.220
may not be brothers from the same mother,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.350
but I watched him grow up

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.590
all these years.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.150
I've always treated him

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.690
like my own brother.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.940
I know his character well.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.570
He might be completely in the dark,

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.030
unaware of the truth,

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.550
believing what his mother has told him.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.200
No matter

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.750
what Empress Zhuang told him,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.470
it must be full of loopholes.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.920
In such a just world,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.050
no one can truly turn black into white.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.090
Chengyang can tell right from wrong.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.030
I trust him.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.680
Although I've never met Feng Chengyang,

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.440
after hearing what you've said,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.070
he sounds like

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.270
a reasonable person.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.670
To maintain a kind heart,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
even with blood ties to the Zhuangs—

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.640
that's really not easy.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.640
I was worried

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.940
that you brothers would become enemies.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
So many royal siblings

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.200
like you would fight

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.960
to the bitter end

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.300
for the throne.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.820
Surprisingly,

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.980
you two are the opposite.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.540
That's truly rare.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.030
If it weren't for the throne,

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.750
my buddies like Gu Yu

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.100
wouldn't have ended up like that.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.230
You are the most important person to me.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.260
After everything,

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.570
I still have you by my side,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.240
and Lu Ke, Yun Fang, and Yun Qing,

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.590
who are not blood relatives

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.920
but are more than family,

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.590
by my side.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.940
I'm already very content.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.060
I didn't expect

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.310
His Highness to suffer so much

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.570
in the Storm Alliance.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.030
Thankfully, Miss Yixiao was

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.490
by his side through it all,

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.240
pulling His Highness

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.840
back from the brink of death.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.420
Let's not talk about that.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.070
How are you?

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.510
Let me see if it's healed.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.830
Just superficial wounds.
They're all healed.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.440
Don't bother.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.640
Why are you acting shy like a girl?

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.550
Just let me check.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.590
What's wrong with you?

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.790
You wanna fight?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.920
Never mind.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.110
I won't fight you.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.270
You're still recovering

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.200
from your injuries.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.080
If I beat you,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.590
it wouldn't be honorable.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.750
You beat me?

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.790
Have you ever beaten me?

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.650
Have I ever fought you seriously?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.550
Didn't I kill

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.310
20 more enemies than you

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.030
on the battlefield?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.750
Fine, fine.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.010
You're the best, okay?

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.550
Just you wait.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:46.790
After I avenge His Highness

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.120
by killing the Murongs,

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.160
we can

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.290
have a proper match.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.510
I'll always be

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.880
one step ahead of you on the battlefield.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.480
Fine.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.090
I'd like to see

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.080
who will really come out on top.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.960
It's a deal then.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.620
It's a deal.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.720
This is a bow
with a draw weight of over two piculs.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.350
Yes.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.680
I thought Your Highness had died

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680
and planned to assassinate the Murongs

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.730
to avenge you.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.750
But they always have

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.070
guards protecting them.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.350
I can only shoot

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:21.480
from 150 paces away.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.860
At that distance,

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.170
you can hit six or seven out of ten.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.830
They're both military commanders.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.630
They wear armor when they go out.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.680
From 150 paces away,

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.200
a kill shot is extremely difficult.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.130
At best, you could hit a vital spot.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.590
But regular bows and arrows

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.750
can't penetrate armor

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.890
even if you hit,

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.110
so you have to use

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.830
a heavy-tipped arrow and a strong bow.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.350
Yes.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.830
A few days ago,

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.210
I secretly got this bow.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.240
If my brother found out,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.880
he'd stop me from taking risks,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.480
so I kept it stashed outside.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.240
However, I've only

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.700
ever used a two-picul bow,

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.960
so I can't guarantee

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.350
a kill shot with this one.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.070
I can try it.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.750
The Moon-Shooting Bow I used before

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.000
had a draw weight of over two piculs.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.480
No.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.140
Lord Ling said

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.920
you can't draw a strong bow.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.520
I've completely recovered.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.790
Look.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.710
Yixiao.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.390
With this bow,

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.880
I can lend you a hand

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.790
and help you deal with the Murongs.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.270
But if you hurt yourself again

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.640
just to kill them,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.270
it's simply not worth it.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.150
Don't worry,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.240
I know my limits.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.630
Don't forget,

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.440
I'm Fu Yixiao after all.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.540
Mind your step.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.960
Someone's coming.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.480
These are

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.610
Song's scout bells.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.920
Once someone gets near this area,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.890
the bells will be

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.020
triggered to ring.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.640
Your Highness,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.510
someone is coming this way

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.270
with guards.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.370
It's Chengyang.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.290
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.030
Your Majesty,

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.310
I'll wait outside

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.240
for you.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.240
Who are you?

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.030
Your brother is waiting for you inside.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.390
Let me see

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.720
what Chengyang looks like

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.200
as an emperor.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.680
Suige,

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.040
it's so wonderful

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.480
to see you again.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.360
You also thought I was dead?

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.550
In the past, every time you returned

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.880
from a victorious campaign,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.210
I'd go welcome you back.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.590
Once, you didn't come back with the army.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.190
They said you died in battle.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.240
I was devastated.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.400
Later, I told you

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.600
that unless you saw my body,

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.010
you shouldn't believe

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.360
any rumors from anyone.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.840
Because your brother

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.630
is the invincible God of War.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.500
Murong Yao said

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.270
your body was left in the wilderness

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.530
and couldn't be found.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.400
I didn't see it with my own eyes,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.660
so I didn't believe it.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.720
Come.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.880
Sit.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:29.880
Brother,

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.670
actually,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.570
ascending to the throne

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.970
was not my wish.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.960
I know.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.480
I already learned about

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.440
what happened between you

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.040
and Grandfather in the past.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.590
Suige,

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.130
why didn't you tell me?

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.790
Telling you would only have worried you

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.640
needlessly.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.310
There's a perpetrator for every injustice.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.880
None of this should have come

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.440
between us brothers.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.310
Why trouble yourself?

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.730
Chengyang,

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.270
I've heard

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.880
you've been secretly investigating

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.510
the truth behind Father's assassination.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.840
The fact
that you came to see me today means

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:06.750
that you still

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.410
care about me as your brother.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:09.350
Brother,

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.110
how did Father really die?

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.640
And who set you up?

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.560
The Murong father and son.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.680
They forged an imperial edict

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.140
to lure me into the palace.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.400
By the time I saw Father,

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.970
he had already passed away.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.690
Who else was involved?

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.880
An event this big…

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.030
I don't believe the Murongs did it

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.400
all on their own.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.680
You're asking me this…

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.790
because you already

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.050
have an answer, right?

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.440
Brother,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.570
I want to hear it from you directly.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.980
Was my mother involved

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.480
in the attempt to murder you?

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.480
I have no proof,

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.840
but she must have been involved.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.630
Chengyang,

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:21.969
I called you here today

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.030
because I hope

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.000
you can prepare yourself in advance.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.840
And I hope you can understand me.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.080
Because what I'm about to do

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.929
is to kill my enemies with my own hands.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.230
Brother,

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.290
I'll return the throne to you.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.480
But may I ask you one thing?

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.730
Spare my mother.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.760
I will take her away from Yujing

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.929
and never come back.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.460
I'm the only family

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.880
my mother has now.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.110
All her mistakes were for my sake.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.320
Her sins are my sins.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.560
Let me pay the price for her.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.320
What have you done wrong?

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.590
You and I are merely

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.990
pawns of circumstances.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.370
Chengyang.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.550
I promise you:

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.400
I will not kill your mother.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.130
Qianqiu Festival?

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.230
Xia Jingyan's Daily Chronicle says

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.280
that every year at the Qianqiu Festival,

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.920
he leaves the palace
to visit his ancestral home.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.120
If we want to kill him,

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.840
that's the best chance.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.590
But for such occasions,

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.050
security is always tight.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.960
There will be countless guards
protecting him,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.420
both openly and secretly.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.960
That's why we need
to use the Empress Dowager.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.670
When Xia Jingyan leaves the palace,

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.060
he'll certainly bring
Feng Xiyang with him.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.000
No one wants Feng Xiyang dead

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.730
more than the Empress Dowager.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.030
She will secretly

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.960
help us reassign most of

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.320
Xia Jingyan's guards.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.170
If that's the case,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.590
our chances of success

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.790
will be much greater.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.840
But will the Empress Dowager agree?

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.070
She definitely will.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.440
She's eager

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.760
to provoke a war between the two kingdoms.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.480
Only then

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.290
will Xia Jingyan
need to rely on her again.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.980
We need to prepare in advance.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.480
It's time to send word to Pingling City

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.810
and call in more people.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:36.840
Understood.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.940
What are you doing?

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.710
Prince of Zhennan,

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.110
His Majesty summons you.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.120
You're angry?

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.510
Who's the fool

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.910
that upset Her Highness?

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.040
It couldn't be me, could it?

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.510
Why would I be angry?

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.240
Xia Jingyan,

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.440
don't think I can't

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.900
take revenge without you.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.430
Interesting.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:29.480
Then tell me,

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.110
what's your plan?

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:30.590
Did you

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.990
just come here to mock me?

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.070
I came to help you.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.070
Get out.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.630
The more ungrateful you are,

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.980
the more I like you.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.090
Bring him in!

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.200
Why did you bring him here?

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.810
I don't want to see him!

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.460
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.400
May I ask why

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.720
you've summoned me?

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.340
You tried to kill my woman,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.160
and you still don't know
why I summoned you?

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.830
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.450
I don't understand.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.400
You forgot quite quickly.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:29.070
Why did you

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.080
go to the Flower Hall?

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.400
You've been visiting

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.260
the Empress Dowager repeatedly.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:34.880
What task did

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.760
she assign you?

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.810
The same as Liang Pin's?

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.580
To kill her?

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.280
I was merely paying

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.740
my regular respects
to the Empress Dowager.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.560
Still won't admit it?

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.550
Good.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.280
You pay your respects more often
than I do.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.140
You're filial.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.000
I'm not.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.870
Is that what you mean?

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.840
You misunderstand.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.590
Then what were you doing

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.650
at the Flower Hall?

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.040
Were you perhaps rekindling a romance?

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.110
I...

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.880
Think carefully about your answer.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.960
If you were rekindling a romance

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.760
with my woman,

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.090
I'd be very displeased.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.210
If not,

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.040
I'd be even more displeased.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.220
You don't find my woman attractive?

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.940
If I'm displeased,

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.670
someone's head will roll.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:26.830
Tell me.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:28.150
Tell me, why did you go to her?

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.750
Was it to rekindle a romance?

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.420
If you want me dead, Your Majesty,

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.280
why bother with finding excuses?

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.710
Who do you think you are?

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.860
Do I need an excuse to kill you?

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.360
At the Flower Hall,

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.960
I had something to say to him.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.710
Prince of Zhennan, have you forgotten?

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.310
I was the one who stopped you
at the Flower Hall.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.930
I asked if you had ever,

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.320
even for a moment,

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.880
imagined growing old with me.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.280
I...

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.960
You...

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.840
You were rekindling a romance with him?

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.070
Don't say that again!

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.480
He and I broke ties long ago.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.610
There's no romance!

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.070
I just

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.620
wanted an answer.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.560
What was your answer?

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.190
Never.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.900

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.500

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.550

♪ Don't cry, don't cry ♪

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.070
are you serious?

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.190
Xia Jingyan, I've told you,

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.840
I can still get my revenge

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.230
without you!

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.220
Let go of me!

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.070
Let me kill him!

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:43.100
-Take him away! Now!
-Let me kill him!

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.590
♪ I'll remember the way home ♪

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.660
Xia Jingshi,

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.800
I'll kill you!

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.400
Listen to me!

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.340
You're from Susha.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.320
If you kill him,

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.070
his followers won't let you go,

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:57.320
nor will the people of Jinxiu!

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.330
Then why did you

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.500
bring him to see me?

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.800
I just wanted to humiliate him

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.590
and scare him a bit
to make you feel better!

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.390
Xia Jingyan,

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.480
remember this:

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.320
I was

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.920
never joking about revenge.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.920
If you dare toy with me again,

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.590
I won't let you off!

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.800
You crazy woman.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.730
What did you say?

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.870
I said I'll remember!

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:48.450
You've seen your brother,

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.490
but why are you even more upset?

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.560
He came to see me today

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.240
because he cares for me as his brother.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.400
But I told him terrible news.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.310
Chengyang has already lost his father.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.190
How will he face

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.670
his mother from now on?

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.290
Usually at times like this,

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.800
wouldn't you offer me

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.800
words of comfort?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.480
Why are you silent this time?

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.760
I was just thinking:

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.670
how can there be someone

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.200
as kind as you in this world?

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:21.440
His mother

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.170
caused you to lose your mother,

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.210
yet you're still worried about

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.070
how he will

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.530
get along with his mother.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.210
After all you've been through,

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.400
I'm really glad

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.480
you still have a younger brother
like Chengyang.
