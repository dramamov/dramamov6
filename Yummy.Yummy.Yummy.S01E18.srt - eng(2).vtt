(Xingjiao Nunnery)

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.750
You've been doing this for six hours.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.920
What's troubling you?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.200
To be honest,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.830
I have a karmic obstacle in my heart.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.520
Please shave my head

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.830
and take me in.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.640
Benefactor,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.030
leaving the secular world won't be easy.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.400
Judging by your age,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.500
it seems you are struggling with love.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.830
Are you trying to escape

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.150
the worldly affairs of love

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.580
through ordination and cultivation?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.330
No.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.310
It can't be.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.040
Denying it.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.990
It must be.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.240
What's the big deal?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
Why come here?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.140
Indeed.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.360
Becoming a nun is serious.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.240
I don't think

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.650
you've thought it through.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.310
My name is Jingwen.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.830
Sorry for disturbing you.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.830
I just want to advise you
to be cautious.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.550
Becoming a nun is not a solution
to all problems.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.400
The meal is ready.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.550
Please have some food.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.870
Benefactor,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.960
please join us.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.800
Please.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.800
I didn't expect the vegetarian meal

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.700
to be so delicious.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.500
Simple yet fresh and tasty.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.460
It highlights the true flavor
of the ingredients.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.060
Lady Jingwen, your cooking is so good.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.340
Who did you learn from?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.300
Thank you for your praise.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.860
I haven't studied under any master.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.120
I learned it all on my own.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.700
Every 1st and 15th of the month,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.580
Lady Jingwen

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.700
comes here

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.100
and cooks for us.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.500
We've asked her to try

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.700
in the Competition in Yong'an next year.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.220
I used to have some trouble

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.700
and wanted to become a nun.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.180
Now, it seems I've found myself a job.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.620
When they brought it up,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.860
I thought about it.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.100
I am idle anyway,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.060
so I'll participate next year.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.900
You'll also participate?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.140
Also?

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.500
My family runs a diner.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.500
My father also plans

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.980
to participate next year.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.500
But with your excellent cooking,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.780
you will surely beat him

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.420
and tell him that there will always be

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.460
someone better.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.300
You assume your father will lose

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.580
even before the Competition?

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.350
You think your father will lose,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.600
yet you're so happy.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.340
Anyway, I support you.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.780
(Miss You in Yong'an)

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.420
Watch out for your hands.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.300
Father, Mother.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.020
Let me introduce you.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.060
This is Lady Jingwen.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.580
We met at Xingjiao Nunnery.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.060
Greetings to all.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.340
Nice to meet you.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.700
Lady Jingwen is so kind.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.980
She invited me for lunch

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.860
and brought me back in a carriage.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.460
Thank you.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.860
Wait.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.460
You didn't have a carriage?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.540
Then why walk all the way
to Xingjiao Nunnery?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.660
Acting crazy?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.010
Lady Jingwen is so beautiful.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.890
Yes.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.220
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.700
Sit down and have some with us.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.060
Feel at home.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.020
Eat as you like.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.300
Yes.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.500
Then I will not refuse.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.380
Come on.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.500
Lady Jingwen, come on.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.340
- Come on.
- Sit.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.540
Make yourself comfortable.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.360
Don't stand on ceremony.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.340
Help yourself.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.180
Come on.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.900
It must be Mr. Lin.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.920
Gongcai.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.780
Go open the door.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.500
Go, go.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.340
Mr. Lin?

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.780
Before your mom went

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.620
to deliver food,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.980
I told her

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.900
to invite Mr. Lin over.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.020
He must try

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.180
our new hot pot.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.540
Mr. Lin is here.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.740
Just in time. Come on.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.060
Have dinner with us.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.860
Greetings, Mr. Lin.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.300
You are

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.700
Supervisor Meng's granddaughter?

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.940
(Shen Jingwen,
Supervisor Meng's granddaughter)

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.620
Supervisor Meng's granddaughter?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.580
Dad,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.820
what does the Supervisor mean?

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.100
How uneducated.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.500
The Supervisor is...

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.300
Jicai,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.800
what does the Supervisor mean?

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.700
The Chancellor.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.020
The Chancellor. The Chancellor?

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.260
The Chancellor...

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.700
Please forgive me.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.620
I did not mean to hide it.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.700
Lady Shen and I hit it off,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.180
and I haven't mentioned that.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.310
Coincidentally,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.560
I am related to the Shen family.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.700
This is Lady Shen,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.100
the granddaughter of Mr. Meng,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.060
Left Supervisor.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.420
Shen...

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.300
Her surname is Shen?

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.640
Shen?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.310
You...

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.820
We share a surname,

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.820
but my father

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.020
has some secrets,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.300
so I claim to be Jingwen.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.700
This is my real name.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.380
I don't like the surname Shen.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.220
It pleases me more
when people mistake me

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.460
for Lady Jingwen.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.540
How wonderful.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.380
Is your surname

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.020
really Shen?

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.690
So,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.100
you are our ancestor.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.620
Ancestor,

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.780
please accept my worship.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.140
Yangyang, don't.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.820
Get up now.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.420
Though she's related to the Chancellor,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.540
you can't call her Ancestor.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.380
It is not proper.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.100
Not proper at all.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.500
Mr. Lin.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.420
Come on, Lady Shen.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.100
Come and sit here.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.140
Lady Shen,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.020
please be seated.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.140
- Sure.
- Please sit.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.980
Mr. Lin.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.180
How can you sit there?

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.740
You should sit here.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.820
Come on, sit.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.500
Sit.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.100
Raise your wine cups.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.500
Form a line.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.300
Come on, hurry.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.740
Line up, line up.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.020
Line up.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.180
Let us raise our glasses

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.980
and offer our prayers.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.500
To our ancestors,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.040
may they live long and in good health,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.100
and bless our descendants

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.980
with prosperity and flourishing.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.660
Drink.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.180
Are you crazy?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.260
We haven't rehearsed this.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.620
I thought everyone would do it.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.820
I...

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.670
Sorry about that.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.580
This child.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.020
Why does your hand always tremble?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020
Yes, yes.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.860
It's my hand.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.100
Mr. Lin, your family is so interesting.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.020
Very

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.140
interesting.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.940
What a perfect match.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.940
They're our ancestors.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.940
(Guixiang Tavern)
How about this place?

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.620
Let's go to Shen's Diner instead.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.340
They are having a hot pot event

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.700
with plenty of cheap varieties.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.420
Will it be too crowded to sit?

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.300
Just wait for a while.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.220
It's economical.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.540
Gentlemen, it's getting cold.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.180
Come and try our charcoal pot.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.580
We're going to Shen's Diner.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.420
Maybe next time.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.380
Sorry.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.220
Gentleman, try ours.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.130
Next time, next time.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.340
How about a bamboo basket?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.380
Young Master,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.060
all the guests have gone
to Shen's Diner.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.060
They must've come up
with some new tricks.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.100
At this time of year,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.540
our charcoal pot is usually

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.700
the most popular.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.580
Our charcoal pot is the best.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.700
Last year,
Yunlai Tavern tried to copy it,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.260
but they couldn't beat us
even with low prices.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.060
What trick has Shen's Diner used?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.980
How about we go and take a look?

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.420
Forget it.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.360
Let's just wait and see for now.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.860
If it doesn't work,

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.100
we'll lower the price.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.960
Gentlemen, come to our place.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.460
Don't leave.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.900
As the weather gets colder,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.460
we officially launch

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.820
the hot pot season event.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.660
(Three Delicacies Pot, Pork Bone Pot)
One pot to cook everything.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.420
(Mutton Pot, Crab Pot)
Delicious food at Shen's Diner.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.180
Only 20 qian

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.980
for one pot.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.340
20 qian!

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.980
20 qian?

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.660
So cheap.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.060
It smells so good.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.700
Smells so good.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.780
So fragrant.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.820
Let me tell you a secret.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.100
We also have the unique

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.460
Chiyan Hot Pot of Yong'an.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.980
If you have it,
you'll surely be pleased and warm.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.620
Pleased and warm!

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.220
Isn't this Guixiang's charcoal pot?

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.900
I can't afford Guixiang's.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.060
Shen's is cheaper.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.260
I can go in and have a taste.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.620
In addition,

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.020
we have launched a special event.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.700
- What event?
- What event?

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.060
What was it again?

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.900
It is our new hot pot season check-in

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.380
and signature-collecting event.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.580
Eating hot pot can be even cheaper.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.340
What is check-in?

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.540
What is signature collection?

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.350
After you finish your hot pot

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.340
and go to pay,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.860
we will give you

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.420
a card like this.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.600
If you collect signatures

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.140
(Chen Chen, Yuan Shen)
from 10 friends,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.340
next time you come for hot pot,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.900
it will only cost 16 qian.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.140
16 qian!

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.260
(Winter Hot Pot Season)

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.540
(Check-in Guide: Chiyan Hot Pot)

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.180
(Cook everything)
16 qian.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.840
- So cheap.
- 16 qian.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.290
- Let's go.
- Let's eat.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.820
Hurry up and have hot pot.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.140
There is also an event.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.900
(Shen's Diner)

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.380
But I didn't order food
from Shen's Diner.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.480
It wasn't a mistake.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.540
It's for you.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.780
Please enjoy your meal.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.340
I'll collect the food box later.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.940
Do you like it?

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.860
Your Highness.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.740
Your Highness,

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.980
how did you just come in?

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.780
You didn't lock the door.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.860
Indeed.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.860
Your house is so poor,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.660
right by the street,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.900
without even a decent courtyard.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.340
There's no need to buy a lock.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.380
I mean,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.140
why did you come uninvited?

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.060
Oh, you ordered this?

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.460
You have a day off,

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.710
and I have nothing to do.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.660
Why not

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.420
have lunch with me?

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.820
Your Highness,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.620
my family is very poor.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.860
I don't eat at noon.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.220
It wouldn't be proper

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.800
for the two of us to have a meal.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.740
The food at Shen's Diner is very cheap,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.700
which enables more people

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.220
to afford three meals a day now.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.820
And this hot pot is only 20 qian.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.020
Mr. Pei,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.220
can't you even afford this hot pot?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.820
Since Mr. Lin

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.300
and you left that day,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.020
we've never met again.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.300
I sent you an invitation,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.540
but you didn't come.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.340
So, I had to come here myself.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.660
Your Highness,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.660
as the Grand Princess of the state,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.580
you bear the dignity
of the imperial family.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.900
You should be careful
with your words and deeds.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.900
You are already married,

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.060
and I am an outsider.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.380
It is not my wish

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.980
to accept your favor without reason.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.860
Your Highness.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.100
Your Highness, wait.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200
Your Highness, wait.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.220
Your Highness.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:09.980
Your Highness.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.740
If you run out

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.860
of my house like this,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.460
and someone sees you...

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.100
Your Highness.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.900
Your Highness.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.460
Mr. Pei,

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.000
the fact that you chased after me

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.100
means you care about me.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.980
It means you have feelings for me,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.820
doesn't it?

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.980
Your Highness, you mustn't.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.340
Your Highness.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.860
Your Highness.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.940
That day, you said I was elegant.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.020
Actually, I am not elegant at all.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.820
As you can see today,

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.700
my life is very poor.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.420
I have money.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.780
I may not necessarily spend it on you,

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.420
but if we're together,

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.020
you won't be a burden, right?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.900
Why can't you understand this?

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.300
Actually, at the poetry gathering,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.260
I just did it on a whim.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.880
I followed others' examples,

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.060
floating cups in the stream,

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.260
cooking tea by the river.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.880
I even borrowed that outfit

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.520
from Anran.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.460
By some strange coincidence,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.180
I won your favor.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.950
In fact,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.060
I had never seen

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.260
that kind of scene before.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.100
I left my hometown,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.660
only wanting to achieve great things

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.920
and bring glory to my ancestors.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.860
I have no other intentions.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.620
I am really not

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.820
the man you think I am.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.380
You're afraid I'll hinder your future?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.460
Yes.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.500
I understand now.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.260
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.780
Mr. Pei,

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.860
I have another request.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.540
In the future,

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.380
can you treat me

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.980
like an ordinary friend,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.260
just like you treat Mr. Lin?

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.180
We can have tea and chat occasionally.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.460
Don't push me away,

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.740
okay?

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.140
Okay.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.020
How about that?

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.380
I retreated to advance.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.340
I don't think Pei Fei can escape

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.660
from my grasp.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.900
You once said

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.360
that without the atmosphere that day,

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.060
Mr. Pei looks

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.540
like an ordinary man,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.820
and his character is nothing special.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.620
Why are you so persistent?

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.540
It's nothing really,

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.580
but I have never had

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.340
a rare thing that I couldn't get.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.500
He's the only one

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.220
who keeps

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.220
rejecting me.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.940
I just have to have him.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.420
(Winter Hot Pot Season:
Unlimited hot pot and desserts)

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.980
(Shen's Diner)

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.060
(Assortment of flavors;
Quick heat on your tongue)

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.540
It's mainly cheap,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.520
isn't it?

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:42.940
Mr. Liu?

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.460
Why didn't you let me know
you were coming?

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.340
How about this hot pot?

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.930
You are an expert. Any tips?

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.820
Your words are too flattering.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.380
We've been making

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.700
charcoal pots for years.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.620
Now, we can't attract guests
even with a price cut.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.820
Today, I've tried yours.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.460
You used smartweed

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.660
instead of cornus for the soup base.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.060
It is spicy and has

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.060
a lingering aftertaste.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.580
We lost fairly.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.060
I also felt that cornus
was not spicy enough.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.620
But this year, our diner

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.780
has so many customers

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.260
just because it's something new.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.860
When next year and the year after come,

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.620
and everyone gets used to hot pots,

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.540
it will be hard to say
who will be chosen.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.300
Sit down.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.860
Are you implying

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.540
that our competition
lies not in this year,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.660
but in the future?

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.300
I never considered you as a rival.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.780
In business,

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.220
one cannot dominate the market alone.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.900
Everyone should innovate,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.740
so when people think of Juxian Alley,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.620
they'll know there is good food here.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.820
It's better to maintain
the current prosperity.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.140
Otherwise,

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.700
other places can easily

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.900
replace us.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.750
Hearing this,

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.260
I feel that your vision is far greater

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.340
than that of other merchants in Juxian.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.140
If we can get your help,

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.500
that would be great.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.900
Your craftsmen make jiaodou woks;

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.980
your excellent chefs must be using them.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.340
We also want your craftsmen to help us

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.140
make flat-bottomed and deep pots
with two handles,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.700
and pots with partitions

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.180
for cooking different dishes.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.620
Pots with two handles

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.740
are available on the market.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.300
Since you're asking,

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.420
you must want some special size.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.540
That's not hard.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.060
The partitioned pot...

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.540
In Records of Wei,

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.300
Cao Pi once gave something

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.620
like that to the Chancellor.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.340
But Lady Shen,

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.300
what will I get in return

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.500
for helping you?

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.420
Do you know

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.940
that crab leg meat can be stripped,

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.820
pressed together,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.340
and made into a dish called crab stick?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.060
Salted egg yolk can be injected

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.520
into fried dough sticks as a filling.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.660
Shrimp meat mixed with egg whites

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.420
can be made into shrimp paste.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.380
Injecting shrimp paste into fried gluten

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.700
creates another new dish.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.020
These recipes

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.020
are my gift.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.140
Send this visit letter to the Princess.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.940
(Yong'an)
Young Master,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.860
do you think Mr. Xiao's notes

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.100
are still in the Princess's hands?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.820
After that accident,

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.460
no one around him has seen
those notes again.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.860
Mr. Xiao is cautious.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.260
He wouldn't leave these things

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.340
where he handles official business.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:17.950
They're more likely to be at home.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.340
This is what Deyuan just sent over.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.900
Go.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.740
Yes.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:34.140
(Shen's Diner)

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.870
Greetings, Mr. Lin.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.940
What a coincidence,

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.780
meeting you here again today.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.380
Mr. Lin is here.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.220
Auntie.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.340
Thank you for delivering

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.140
the food box yourself.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.980
Next time,
we'll send someone to pick it up.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.860
It's okay.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.060
I was heading to Yunshui Manor;

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.900
it's on the way.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.960
Is our diner on the way
from the Prefecture

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.300
to Yunshui Manor?

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.820
Yes.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.980
You haven't had dinner, right?

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.500
Stay and have a meal with us.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.060
Lady Jingwen just came back late

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.700
from praying

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.000
in Xingjiao Nunnery today.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.340
There was no dinner left at home.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.660
She'll have it here.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.060
Jicai has made a new kind of pot.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.540
Stay and taste it.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:30.740
Thank you, Auntie.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.940
You're welcome. Come here.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.940
Mr. Lin, this way.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.780
Come on.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.940
Mr. Lin, sit here.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.780
Please, take a seat.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.940
Lady Jingwen, come.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.100
Come and sit.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.940
Please, take a seat.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.740
Sit here for a while.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.900
Such a predestined encounter.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.140
What a good coincidence.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.380
What a perfect match.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.820
Come on, look.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.780
Our new dishes today.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.380
Desserts to go with the hot pot.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.740
This one here

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.180
is Red Bean Taro Ball.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.180
And this

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.340
is Fruit Platter.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.260
Please enjoy.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.140
Thank you, Auntie.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:09.980
Thank you.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:10.820
You're welcome.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.100
I'll get back to work.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:12.940
Hurry up.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.100
The Pickled Vinegar Pot is here.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.020
Mr. Lin.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.580
Jingwen,

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.660
since you are a vegetarian,

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.220
Mr. Liu and I have specially created

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.720
this Pickled Vinegar Pot with radish
and tender bamboo shoot.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.890
Give it a try.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.570
It has a tangy and spicy flavor,

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.860
which is very appetizing.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.140
Do have some more.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.260
The Pickled Vinegar Pot
with mutton and radish is here.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.900
Let me help you.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.080
Jingwen, you are a vegetarian,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.680
and Mr. Lin, you prefer a light taste.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.980
You two can share this one.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.780
We'll go to the table
with the meat dishes.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.540
Hurry, sit down and eat.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.180
Please.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.620
Please.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.660
Here.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.990
Lady Shen.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.840
Thank you.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.280
Come on, eat.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.980
- Eat up.
- Have some soup first.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.220
Taste it, taste it.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.060
I'll give it a try.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.180
This one.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.020
How is it?

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.620
Delicious, right?

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.020
My grandfather has told me
a lot about you.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.580
Though young,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.750
you've often debated in the court.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.380
I didn't know you were so quiet.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.820
Not really.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.620
Perhaps it's because the pot
is too sour.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.660
It seems you don't like sour flavors.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.060
My grandfather wants to have you over.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.940
I should let him know in advance.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.260
This is so good.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.060
I have another matter

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.860
I'd like to discuss with you.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.060
What is it?

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.900
I've noticed

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.580
that there is an empty place nearby.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.380
I wonder if you're interested.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.100
If you are,

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.140
I am willing to invest.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:31.980
How about that?

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.020
Really?

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.980
I've been looking
at that place several times.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.780
The rent is a bit high, though.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.060
If you're willing to invest,

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.860
we could share the profits according

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.260
to the proportion of the investment.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.380
These terms are quite new to me.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.140
I haven't heard of them,

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.140
but I seem to understand what they mean.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.440
To a great partnership.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.940
To a great partnership.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.540
Wait a moment.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.220
There's a piece of mutton.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.980
It must have been mixed in by accident.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.580
Thank you.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.700
If not for your reminder,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.780
I would've broken my rule.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.790
Why aren't you eating?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.980
The pot has been boiling for too long.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.340
It tastes a bit sour.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.620
Sour?

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.220
Not to me.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.620
(Guixiang Tavern)

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.770
It's called a hot pot,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.360
but it's truly different
from the charcoal pot.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.580
(Elder Liu, Liu Feng's grandfather)
Eat the pot base

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.480
before adding soup

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.900
to cook other dishes.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.100
It has a unique flavor.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.500
Especially this Chiyan Hot Pot,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.980
with smartweed to cook the soup base.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.740
It's used so well.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.260
No one in Yong'an's catering industry

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.060
has ever dared to try this before.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.020
Lady Shen, though young,

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.380
has many good business ideas.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:28.780
No wonder her diner

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.300
has been booming in just half a year.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.700
If she wasn't good enough,

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.100
I wouldn't want to cooperate
with her, right?

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.920
After this, go and check the accounts

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.280
and figure out how to share the profits.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.740
Okay, Grandfather.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.620
Feng,

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.460
are you and Lady Shen

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.980
just doing business,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.920
or is there something more

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.900
between you two?

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.740
Before you mentioned it,

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.820
I never thought about it that way.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.220
Now that I think about it,

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.940
compared to those quiet
and gentle women,

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.660
Lady Shen is more interesting.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.780
That's for later.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.160
I'll go check the accounts.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.460
Go ahead.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.580
Tomorrow morning,

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.760
let's go to Shen's Diner.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.660
(Life's big events: eat & drink)

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.580
(May wealth come)

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.520
Sir,

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.320
please come in.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.500
- It's cold today.
- Sure.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.700
How about having a hot pot?

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.800
Our specially made pot base

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.300
is something you can't find elsewhere.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.340
Spicy ones are appetizing,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.280
sour ones go with rice,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.680
and pork bone ones are nourishing

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.620
and more healthful.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.980
What a clever tongue you have.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.740
With your words,

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.100
even those who didn't come
for the hot pot

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.500
would have to give it a try.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.660
But

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.100
your diner isn't open yet, right?

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.940
We can't keep the guests waiting,
can we?

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.990
Please sit.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.420
The kitchen can start at once.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.460
Sure.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.300
Alright, alright.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.300
Come on.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.100
Here.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.540
What's this?

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.500
Liu Feng from Guixiang Tavern

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.060
is my grandson.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.060
Today, I've prepared a small gift

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.140
to thank you for taking care of him.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.300
Greetings, Elder Liu.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.380
Nice to meet you.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.460
You flatter me.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.300
It's Mr. Liu who has taken care of us.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.460
Come on.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.940
- Please look.
- You're too kind.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.060
This is the Dragon and Phoenix Cake.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.540
It is said

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.900
that when Liu Bei wanted to form

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.100
an alliance with Sun Quan
through marriage,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.180
he searched everywhere
for skilled craftsmen

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.100
to prepare a gift
for their first meeting.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.820
A famous chef from Jingzhou

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.540
carved dragon and phoenix patterns

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.340
on this cake,

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.420
helping the two families
unite in marriage,

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.140
with auspicious meanings.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.460
I also had this cake

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.820
specially made,

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.740
taking a total of 49 days.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.660
Sir,

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.060
you got here so soon.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.060
Just now, I ran into this old man

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.100
at Huanji in West Market.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.860
He asked me how to get to Shen's Diner,

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.100
and I showed him the way.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.500
We even listened to the owner of Huanji

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.900
tell us the story of

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.620
Liu Bei's marriage alliance
with Sun Quan

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.900
and the wedding cake.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.140
Yes, yes.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.340
Wait.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.700
This is a wedding cake.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.020
Huanji in West Market seems to sell

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.780
wedding supplies, doesn't it?

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.540
Wedding cake?

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.730
Yes, yes.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.740
Today, I am here on behalf of Feng

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.140
to propose to Lady Shen.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.760
So,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.180
the young master of Guixiang Tavern

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.740
has taken a liking to my sister?

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.400
How could that be possible?

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.860
Someone is proposing to Jicai?

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.940
Auntie, are you getting married?

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.420
Is this a mistake?

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.980
I'm old,

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.700
and I only have one grandson.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.140
I wouldn't make a mistake

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.820
about his life's big event, would I?

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.700
He really has taken a liking to her.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.700
But I have just one question

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.100
I can't figure out.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.140
What does he see in her?

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.380
She has no charm at all.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.140
I have no charm?

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.340
Feng's parents passed away early,

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.660
and I raised him all by myself.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.340
Now, all I hope for is

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.300
that he can get married soon,

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.580
live harmoniously with his wife.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.100
Lady Shen is straightforward,

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.980
smart and resourceful,

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.540
and she is very good at business.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.140
She is a perfect match.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.180
Who? Who is smart?

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.140
You mean her?

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.780
You don't know.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.220
When she was 15,

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.300
she was even deceived.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.620
Do you remember that year?

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.140
Someone told her she had won a prize,

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.280
and she dragged our parents

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.340
to deliver the handling fee

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.980
to the fraud to get the prize money.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.140
You don't have to bring up old stories.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.540
What a coincidence.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.260
When Feng was 15

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.700
and first started doing business,

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.180
he also lost a gold ingot

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.380
to a fraud.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.020
You don't know.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.420
To get us to pay

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.580
the handling fee for her,

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.900
she even went

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.860
on a hunger strike at home.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.640
Look at that.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.580
How good Lady Shen is at negotiating.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.740
Forget it.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.900
She was pretending
to go on a hunger strike.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.140
Every night,
she'd sneak into the kitchen

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.980
and eat more than I did.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.820
Exactly.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.660
Lady Shen is...

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.620
How could you do that?

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.340
However,

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.420
Jicai is

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.060
indeed a good girl.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.220
But her marriage

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.460
is serious.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.900
It needs to be considered carefully.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.740
Yes, yes.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.340
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.140
This is the dessert

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.040
that Shen's Diner has paired
with the hot pot.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.460
Your Highness, please taste it.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.980
You didn't come all the way here

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.340
just to bring me some food, right?

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.100
How wise of you.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.180
Naturally,

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.670
I have something to ask.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.620
It's

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.820
about Pei Fei.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.780
Looking at this dessert,

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.780
I suddenly feel a bit hungry.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.900
Liu Chang, it's almost noon.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.060
Go order some food at Shen's Diner.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:33.900
Yes.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.780
Does Mr. Pei have to tell you

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:44.940
everything?

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.260
That day,

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.100
when you invited Lady Shen to cook here,

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.060
Pei Fei felt very embarrassed.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.580
He should've complained
to me for 49 days,

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.140
but he never mentioned you.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.540
That's what made me more curious.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.500
So, he didn't tell you.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.460
He didn't tell you,

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.460
yet you came all the way here.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.740
So, you also have the habit

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.900
of gossiping about love affairs?

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.260
Everyone has

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.140
some quirks.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.420
In fact, days ago,

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.020
Mr. Pei had agreed

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.660
that he'd treat me
as an ordinary friend.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.740
However,

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.140
he still avoids me.

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:34.140
If you want to see this play,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.300
why not arrange more meetings for us?

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:41.860
Your Highness,

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.020
Pei Fei is my close friend.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.660
I do not interfere

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.780
in his personal affairs,

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.260
nor do I wish to.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.620
Since you value your friends so much,

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.420
let it be.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.500
Though it is common for the Censorate

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.220
and the Prefecture
to have good relations,

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.660
I am not very perceptive.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.980
If one day I say something wrong
in front of my brother,

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:11.940
and he misunderstands

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.740
that you two have private dealings...

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.300
But I also think

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.660
since Pei Fei has had trouble
finding a good match,

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.740
your favor is not necessarily
a bad thing.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.380
However,

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.260
with Mr. Xiao still around,

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.140
Pei Fei has always been hesitant.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.900
I wonder

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.180
if you still keep the things

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.480
that Mr. Xiao used in daily life?

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.260
No one has touched his things.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.140
What did he leave behind?

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.060
Some tokens of love?

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.780
What tokens of love
could he have for me?

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.220
He had someone he favored.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.420
Even if he had left something,

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.300
it would've been for that woman.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.100
Unfortunately,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.820
after his accident,

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.500
that lady just went ahead
and got married.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.660
What is left at home now

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.340
are the notes he carried

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.500
with him

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.660
for solving cases,

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.820
some of which he asked

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.100
to be locked in a box.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.340
If Pei Fei sees

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.660
your husband's things,

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.540
it might be harder for him
to get close to you.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.900
I have long admired Mr. Xiao.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.820
How nice that he still kept those notes.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.700
They must be about old cases,

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.960
and it'll be okay if they leak.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.860
Could you lend them to me for a look?

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.620
I will take care of them,

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.300
and it won't intimidate Pei Fei.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.380
If you could make Mr. Pei cherish me,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.300
you can have

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.780
whatever you want.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.180
Young Master.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.640
Your Highness, would you like to dine?

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.900
Where's the food?

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.860
I planned to order from Shen's Diner,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.780
but on the way, I heard

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.140
that the owner of Guixiang Tavern

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.540
is proposing to Lady Shen,

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.740
and the diner is temporarily closed.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.660
I still have official duties,

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.700
so I'll take my leave.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.660
How considerate of you.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.140
But marriage

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.860
is still up

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.220
to the children themselves.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.620
Of course.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.500
Of course what?

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.460
Is it that easy to marry my daughter?

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.220
Jicai, do you want to get married?

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.460
Of course not.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.500
If you don't want to,
just say it out loud.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.700
With your father here,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.180
who dares to force you?

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.820
(Liu Feng,)

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.940
(And he's capable himself.)

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.840
(What a typical dominant CEO.)

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.780
(It seems perfect for me to stop)

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.220
(those improper thoughts.)

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:06.860
Jicai,

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.060
what are you afraid of?

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.540
Say something.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.340
I don't...

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.500
Mr. Lin?

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.620
Why did Mr. Lin come?

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:39.900
This...

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.500
Lady Shen, what is this about?

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.980
You...

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.860
You agreed?

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.020
I'll go tell Feng right away.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.620
You really agreed?

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.470
How could you agree?

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.660
Have you really decided
to marry his grandson?

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.100
Why did Mr. Lin leave?

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.980
Yes.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.380
What did he come for?

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.540
Mr. Lin.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.100
I followed you all the way,
but you didn't notice.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.500
Your Highness.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.140
You said you had someone you admired.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.180
So, it's Lady Shen.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.420
Then why didn't you stop someone

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.580
from proposing to her?

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.620
You dared to go
against my brother's wishes,

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.060
but you didn't dare to confess
your feelings to her?

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.540
She has her own choice.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.420
I can't ignore her will.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.420
If you can really be content,

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.620
that's fine.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.020
But look at your face.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.740
There is a difference

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.860
between not wanting to say it

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.900
and not daring to say it.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.380
I won't talk to a coward.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.220
Let's go.
