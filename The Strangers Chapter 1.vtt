So I'm thinking rustic, very,

03:39.208 --> 03:41.407
and a stone chimney
right in the middle.

03:41.407 --> 03:43.709
Yeah, totally.
Like a witch's house.

03:43.709 --> 03:45.546
Where are you going to put
your broomstick collection?

03:45.546 --> 03:47.413
How about the cage that
you're gonna be sleeping in,

03:47.413 --> 03:48.881
'cause you won't
be sleeping with me.

03:50.114 --> 03:52.319
- Oh.
- What?

03:52.319 --> 03:54.453
Three hundred more miles
to Portland.

03:54.453 --> 03:56.293
I'm gonna need to eat
before then.

03:58.226 --> 03:59.862

04:12.241 --> 04:14.674
Hey, do you know
what today is?

04:15.308 --> 04:16.576
Today is the third day

04:16.576 --> 04:18.211
of our three-day road trip
across the country.

04:18.211 --> 04:19.875
Or our five-year anniversary.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.984
Anniversary? I just picked
you up in Chicago.

04:21.984 --> 04:23.480
Best 16 hours of your life.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.816
I love you.

04:25.518 --> 04:27.251
- Shit! Shit!

04:32.130 --> 04:33.759
-Fuck off!

04:35.331 --> 04:37.059
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

04:46.603 --> 04:50.374
Hey. Hey, calm down.
It's over.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.214
Do you want your inhaler?

04:52.214 --> 04:54.410
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks, babe.
- Here.

05:09.498 --> 05:11.727
Ally shows our funds
came through.

05:11.727 --> 05:13.634
Where even
are we right now?

05:14.070 --> 05:16.103
Oh, shit, no signal.

05:16.103 --> 05:17.202
- Okay.
- Keep driving,

05:17.202 --> 05:18.540
maybe it'll pick up.

05:19.675 --> 05:22.077
We are actually
in the middle of nowhere.

05:22.077 --> 05:23.772
Now I know what it looks like.

05:23.772 --> 05:26.347
We might just die
of starvation.

05:26.347 --> 05:27.747
She was on her way

05:27.747 --> 05:29.379
to interview for a top
Portland architectural firm

05:29.379 --> 05:31.782
when her GPS failed.

05:31.782 --> 05:33.453
She is however survived

05:33.453 --> 05:34.752
- by her boyfriend, Ryan...
- What? No.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.888
Yes. Sorry, babe,
I had to eat your remains.

05:38.655 --> 05:40.755
Ah! Civilization.

05:40.755 --> 05:45.369
Venus, Oregon.
468.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.109
- What a cool little town.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

06:01.681 --> 06:03.750
I could eat
a whole fucking cow.

06:27.307 --> 06:28.810
Sit anywhere.

06:28.810 --> 06:29.941
Thanks.

06:51.232 --> 06:53.602
- What?
- Just Debbie and Howard.

06:56.334 --> 06:57.538
So cute.

06:57.538 --> 06:58.901
Are you having FOMO
about missing Howard's

06:58.901 --> 07:01.841
kiss-my-ass
birthday extravaganza?

07:02.674 --> 07:05.181
Well, it is a kiss-my-ass

07:05.181 --> 07:07.750
birthday extravaganza
in Greece,

07:07.750 --> 07:08.912
so yes.

07:08.912 --> 07:11.116
Why be in Greece
when you can be in Venus?

07:12.253 --> 07:14.018
Hi, y'all. My name's Shelly.

07:14.586 --> 07:15.785
Soup is beef chili.

07:15.785 --> 07:17.260
Pies are huckleberry
and apple.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.657
Can I get you
something to drink?

07:18.657 --> 07:20.958
Can we start off
with two iced teas?

07:20.958 --> 07:23.359
And do you have any
vegetarian recommendations?

07:23.359 --> 07:24.699
Annie?

07:25.201 --> 07:26.369
Got a vegetarian here.

07:26.369 --> 07:29.165
I like the Carol's Salad,
hold the bacon.

07:29.766 --> 07:31.167
Um, that sounds great.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.936
Yeah, actually, can we get
the bacon and extra cheese

07:33.936 --> 07:35.411
and put that
on a turkey melt for me?

07:35.411 --> 07:36.975
You got it.
Great. Thanks.

07:38.316 --> 07:39.674
Could you eat
any less healthy?

07:39.674 --> 07:41.180
It's my anniversary.

07:42.284 --> 07:43.949
Oh my God,
it's their anniversary.

07:44.385 --> 07:45.920
Ours too, almost.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.087
Two years.

07:47.087 --> 07:48.757
Eden. Neil.

07:48.757 --> 07:49.619
Hey.

07:49.619 --> 07:52.592
I'm Maya and this is Ryan.

07:52.592 --> 07:53.957
And how long
you guys been married?

07:53.957 --> 07:56.530
- We're not. We're not married.

07:56.530 --> 07:58.700
We've just been dating
for five years.

08:00.632 --> 08:01.964
Five years

08:01.964 --> 08:04.637
and you ain't put a ring
on her finger?

08:04.637 --> 08:06.510
What the hell
are you waiting for?

08:07.844 --> 08:10.041
Well, right now, I'm just
waiting on my turkey melt.

08:14.778 --> 08:15.985
Tough crowd, right?

08:22.653 --> 08:24.156
Anything else?

08:24.156 --> 08:25.256
Got it.

08:25.256 --> 08:26.891
Yeah, um,

08:26.891 --> 08:29.093
we could use some directions
to the highway.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.130
On the back.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.139
He was some
big corporate finance guy.

08:39.139 --> 08:40.643
Passed through.

08:40.643 --> 08:43.613
Ate here, actually,
and then totally disappeared.

08:44.449 --> 08:46.049
Hope he didn't
have the turkey melt.

08:46.049 --> 08:47.881
- He did.

08:51.154 --> 08:52.248
Okay.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.065
What's going on?

09:08.270 --> 09:09.505
Car won't start.

09:09.505 --> 09:10.939
Take the key out of your
pocket and try it again.

09:10.939 --> 09:12.007
Good call.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.341
All right.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.816
-Shit.

09:27.993 --> 09:29.593
Car trouble?

09:32.864 --> 09:34.094
Yeah.

09:34.094 --> 09:35.262
I'm Rudy.

09:35.262 --> 09:36.699
That's my garage.

09:41.735 --> 09:43.633
Yeah, your alternator's shot.

09:43.633 --> 09:44.966
You need a new one.

09:44.966 --> 09:46.368
How long will that take?

09:47.344 --> 09:48.343
We gotta pick up the part

09:48.343 --> 09:49.942
from the dealer
over in Eugene.

09:49.942 --> 09:52.409
Is that something you could
maybe do tonight?

09:52.409 --> 09:53.749
Tonight?

09:54.418 --> 09:55.915
They're already closed.

09:55.915 --> 09:58.314
I can send Dougie
first thing in the morning.

09:58.982 --> 10:00.752
Install it in the afternoon.

10:00.752 --> 10:02.626
So we'd have to spend
the night?

10:03.594 --> 10:05.988
Is there anywhere
to stay close by?

10:05.988 --> 10:08.123
Well, motel's closed
for repairs,

10:08.123 --> 10:12.227
but there's one of them
Internet houses.

10:12.227 --> 10:14.602
He means an Airbnb.
There's an older guy,

10:14.602 --> 10:16.371
Joe Gressis.
He rents it out sometimes.

10:16.371 --> 10:18.603
Except during hunting season.

10:18.603 --> 10:19.870
Yeah, Joe likes to hunt.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.640
He's there
from August to December.

10:21.640 --> 10:22.976
But he keeps it pretty nice.

10:23.345 --> 10:25.107
- Okay.
- No, no.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.077
This is a scam.
I saw you watching us.

10:27.077 --> 10:29.653
Will you excuse us
for one second, please?

10:30.453 --> 10:31.486
Ryan, what's wrong with you?

10:31.486 --> 10:32.653
These people
aren't scamming us.

10:32.653 --> 10:34.150
You just think
this is a coincidence?

10:34.150 --> 10:36.085
The mechanic watched us
going into the diner

10:36.085 --> 10:37.589
and then suddenly
he's fixing our car

10:37.589 --> 10:38.858
that wasn't even broken.

10:38.858 --> 10:40.195
We literally almost
got into a car wreck,

10:40.195 --> 10:41.256
like, an hour ago.

10:41.256 --> 10:42.793
Something might have
gotten messed up, okay?

10:42.793 --> 10:44.464
Please stop being paranoid.

10:44.464 --> 10:45.530
Please stop being naive.

10:45.530 --> 10:46.696
You know what, Rudy?

10:46.696 --> 10:47.764
That sounds great.

10:47.764 --> 10:49.637
We appreciate it. Thanks.

10:49.637 --> 10:51.606
Dougie'll tow your car
to the garage,

10:51.606 --> 10:53.136
then I guess
he can drive you two.

10:53.136 --> 10:55.474
I'm off in, like, 10 minutes.
I can drive you.

10:55.474 --> 10:56.905
I live out that way.

10:56.905 --> 10:58.640
That's so kind of you.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.549
Thank you.

11:00.549 --> 11:02.983
Yeah. Good tippers,
good karma, right?

11:04.849 --> 11:06.118
What?

11:10.690 --> 11:12.157
- Hi.
-Hi.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.732

13:17.314 --> 13:18.855
Wow!
Would you look at that?

13:18.855 --> 13:21.825
- What?
- A number to call
if there's any problems.

13:22.526 --> 13:24.058
Get 'em while they're cold.

13:26.628 --> 13:28.291
This is Maya Lucas.

13:28.291 --> 13:32.999
I am renting your beautiful
property, and...

13:32.999 --> 13:34.503
you know, thank you
for the short notice.

13:34.503 --> 13:36.769
I'm actually calling because

13:36.769 --> 13:38.568
your refrigerator is broken,

13:38.568 --> 13:42.004
and hoping that you could
maybe send someone to fix it.

13:42.004 --> 13:43.240
We'll be here all night

13:43.240 --> 13:45.145
and this is a great number
to reach me at.

13:45.579 --> 13:46.916
Thank you.

14:01.993 --> 14:03.262
Do you hear that?

14:03.927 --> 14:05.330
Hear what?

14:06.403 --> 14:08.397
The silence.

14:08.397 --> 14:13.709
No car horns,
no 5:00 a.m. garbage truck,

14:13.709 --> 14:16.410
no crazy person
yelling at 2:00 a.m.

14:16.410 --> 14:19.883
Yeah, that's 'cause
there's nothing
within five miles of this place.

14:22.585 --> 14:25.218
But it's nice, right?

14:28.291 --> 14:29.387
Yeah.

14:30.359 --> 14:31.521
It is.

14:35.697 --> 14:37.997
So, isn't this the best

14:37.997 --> 14:39.560
five-year anniversary
you've had?

14:39.560 --> 14:43.368
You know, I would say
it is one of the best.

14:49.810 --> 14:51.178
What are you thinking?

14:51.178 --> 14:54.210
I'm thinking about how
that greasy motherfucker Rudy

14:54.210 --> 14:56.311
better have my car
in by tomorrow.

14:56.311 --> 15:00.022
Wow, I am so turned on
right now.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.389
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

15:02.389 --> 15:03.652
Prove it.

15:13.133 --> 15:14.668
To be clear,
I may be kissing you,

15:14.668 --> 15:16.470
but I'm thinking of Rudy.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.007
Oh, fuck off.

16:30.646 --> 16:32.576
Is Tamara here?

16:35.583 --> 16:36.817
No.

16:36.817 --> 16:38.648
I think you have
the wrong home.

17:01.545 --> 17:02.738
That was weird.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.511
Where'd she even come from?

17:08.919 --> 17:10.647
We're out in the middle
of nowhere.

I think I know
the state motto now.

17:40.145 --> 17:41.810
"It's better in Oregon."

17:43.182 --> 17:44.549
Well, it is now.

17:49.456 --> 17:51.088
This house kinda
reminds me of that place

17:51.088 --> 17:52.590
we stayed near Woodstock.

17:54.126 --> 17:55.965
Rondout Valley?

17:55.965 --> 17:58.200
That was more glamping
than it was camping.

18:00.803 --> 18:02.237
You know, I...

18:06.643 --> 18:07.737
I thought...

18:08.478 --> 18:09.640
What?

18:11.975 --> 18:15.013
Do you remember that hike
we went on up to the Vista

18:15.013 --> 18:16.746
and that gorgeous sunset?

18:22.652 --> 18:24.886
It just felt like
the perfect...

18:26.494 --> 18:29.724
Maya, I thought you didn't
want to get married.

18:29.724 --> 18:32.597
Ryan, I said that,
like, five years ago.

18:33.463 --> 18:35.600
Yeah, you never unsaid it.

18:39.371 --> 18:41.408
If I get the job in Portland,

18:42.780 --> 18:44.312
you'll move with me, right?

18:45.515 --> 18:46.578
Yeah.

18:47.717 --> 18:48.877
Yeah, of course.

18:50.384 --> 18:52.281
I know how much
the city means to you

18:52.281 --> 18:54.157
and what you're giving up.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.886
I know you're doing it for me.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.628
So...

19:05.865 --> 19:07.170
do you?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.868
I know I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

19:17.945 --> 19:19.215
You know what?

19:19.948 --> 19:21.048
I'll surprise you.

19:21.048 --> 19:23.248
Well, maybe
not a full surprise

19:23.248 --> 19:24.551
because I do have
some ideas...

19:24.551 --> 19:25.683
No.

19:32.060 --> 19:33.724
Where's my stupid inhaler?

19:38.031 --> 19:39.400
Shit.

19:39.800 --> 19:40.862
What?

19:40.862 --> 19:42.331
Ryan, I don't think
I put it back in your bag.

19:42.331 --> 19:44.268
I think it's in the car.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.306
Damn it. No, no, it's okay.

19:46.306 --> 19:48.475
It's not your fault.
I should've checked.

19:51.341 --> 19:52.443
You know what,

19:52.443 --> 19:53.976
there's an old motorcycle
out front.

19:53.976 --> 19:56.712
I can just drive it into town
and take it out of the car.

19:56.712 --> 19:58.881
Have you ever ridden
a motorcycle before?

19:59.790 --> 20:01.521
Yeah, a few times.

20:02.022 --> 20:03.889
- Also...
- What?

20:03.889 --> 20:05.228
I'm hungry.

20:06.630 --> 20:07.725
I'm on it.

20:21.771 --> 20:24.275
I see Howard
is truly enjoying Greece

20:24.275 --> 20:25.741
and everything
it has to offer.

20:25.741 --> 20:28.680
<i>What bumblefuck town
are you guys in now?</i>

20:29.149 --> 20:31.415
Uh, Venus, Oregon.

20:31.415 --> 20:33.055
It's a cute,
quaint little spot.

20:33.055 --> 20:34.387
<i>Okay. Well,
you give me the nod,</i>

20:34.387 --> 20:36.188
<i>I'll get Howard
to get a private plane,</i>

20:36.188 --> 20:37.556
<i>get you two guys over here.</i>

20:37.556 --> 20:39.493
We're fine. Really,
we're having a good time.

20:39.493 --> 20:41.392
<i>Is that a nod? You want me
to pull the trigger?</i>

20:41.392 --> 20:43.332
<i>- Howard. Howard.</i>

20:44.597 --> 20:45.931
Oh, my God,
you already looked into it,

20:45.931 --> 20:46.998
didn't you?

20:49.037 --> 20:50.332
Debbie, I gotta go.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.835
I love you. Behave.

20:55.007 --> 20:56.477
Ryan?

21:04.749 --> 21:07.488
Ry, I knew you couldn't
ride a motorcycle.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.794
Ryan?

21:32.011 --> 21:33.079
Ryan?

21:37.313 --> 21:38.585
Hello?

21:52.529 --> 21:55.369
Is Tamara here?

21:55.369 --> 21:59.507
No, we already told you
there is no Tamara here.

22:23.733 --> 22:24.961
Hello?

22:56.560 --> 22:58.797
Is Tamara here?

23:25.491 --> 23:27.529
Ryan, please get back here.

I don't know. It...

25:52.769 --> 25:55.138
It was really weird.

all right?

27:58.762 --> 28:00.802
You should have called first.

28:01.371 --> 28:03.704
Yeah. Yeah, I just didn't...

28:03.704 --> 28:05.106
Could have thought
you were a car thief.

28:05.106 --> 28:06.742
Hey, hey. Hey.

28:09.213 --> 28:10.944
I'm gonna go, okay?

28:18.219 --> 28:19.282
Got it.

28:22.491 --> 28:24.122
You have a good night, Rudy.

30:31.918 --> 30:33.185
...what do you expect?

30:34.116 --> 30:35.653
Hey, it's New York guy.

30:36.718 --> 30:38.090
New York!

30:38.090 --> 30:41.660
How was the turkey melt,
extra bacon, extra cheese?

30:41.660 --> 30:44.031
It was great. Very cheesy.

30:45.195 --> 30:47.469
Wanna join us? We got plenty.

30:47.469 --> 30:49.097
No, thanks. I gotta get back.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.137
Come on, have a beer with us.

30:51.137 --> 30:53.975
Maybe another time.
Have a good night, all right?

30:53.975 --> 30:57.278
Thinks he's too good
for us local shitkickers, huh?

31:02.250 --> 31:03.885
Good evening.

31:03.885 --> 31:06.920
Um, can I please get
a cheeseburger and fries?

31:06.920 --> 31:08.990
And then another cheeseburger,
but no meat.

31:10.220 --> 31:11.993
My girlfriend's a vegetarian.

31:13.427 --> 31:14.556
Larry.

31:15.893 --> 31:17.727
Cheers!

31:17.727 --> 31:19.066
Thanks.

31:23.637 --> 31:25.534
Oh. No, thanks.

31:26.575 --> 31:28.108
I got one earlier today.

32:59.196 --> 33:00.464
Great.

34:58.282 --> 35:00.287
- Shit.

36:19.496 --> 36:20.660
Maya, what are you doing here?

36:20.660 --> 36:22.435
- Why are the lights off?

36:22.871 --> 36:25.301
Hey, what's wrong?

36:25.301 --> 36:27.273
There's somebody in the house.

36:27.273 --> 36:29.742
- And they shut the lights off?
- I don't know.

36:29.742 --> 36:31.246
Okay, okay.

36:32.081 --> 36:33.644
I'm gonna go
find the fuse box.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.482
Ryan, did you see
anybody out there?

36:37.454 --> 36:38.616
No.

36:39.616 --> 36:41.050
Okay. I know
where the fuse box is.

36:41.050 --> 36:42.422
I'll show you.

36:43.088 --> 36:44.154
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:44.154 --> 36:46.360
Hey, come on. Come on.

36:47.190 --> 36:48.560
I got you.

36:50.064 --> 36:51.728
- Found it.

36:57.872 --> 36:58.966
All better.

37:00.402 --> 37:01.870
What happened?

37:03.046 --> 37:04.972
Someone was standing
right there.

37:07.884 --> 37:09.651
Are you sure? It was dark.

37:09.651 --> 37:11.214
- Yes.
- Yeah?

37:11.214 --> 37:13.048
They were wearing a mask.

37:13.048 --> 37:14.249
A mask?

37:14.249 --> 37:15.316
What kind of mask?

37:15.316 --> 37:16.553
I don't know, Ryan.

37:16.553 --> 37:19.288
Like a weird,
creepy mask with big eyes,

37:19.288 --> 37:21.560
and he was right there.

37:29.234 --> 37:30.503
I know what happened.

37:38.210 --> 37:39.710
Is that what you saw?

37:41.850 --> 37:44.015
I mean, maybe.

37:44.015 --> 37:45.518
I also heard them.

37:48.385 --> 37:49.720
Were you smoking?

37:51.722 --> 37:53.019
I mean, I smoked
a little bit earlier,

37:53.019 --> 37:54.558
but I don't think that's
anything to do with this.

37:54.558 --> 37:57.057
I told you, that
<i>Freak Brothers</i> shit is strong.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.797
Okay? You're in
an unfamiliar house.

38:01.464 --> 38:03.534
It's pitch black.

38:03.534 --> 38:05.736
I would have thought
I saw something too.

38:10.207 --> 38:11.942
I'm so sick of this shit.

38:11.942 --> 38:13.942
Ry. Ry!

38:25.322 --> 38:26.691
What is it?

38:27.697 --> 38:28.759
That girl.

38:30.130 --> 38:31.625
What's she doing?

38:31.625 --> 38:35.599
Just standing, watching us.

38:35.599 --> 38:37.034
I can't tell.
Is she wearing a mask?

38:37.034 --> 38:38.405
I don't know.

38:38.405 --> 38:40.168
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting an end to this.

38:40.168 --> 38:41.536
Ryan.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.741
- Ryan!
- What's your problem?

38:45.112 --> 38:46.112
I asked you a ques...

38:46.112 --> 38:48.478
Yeah, fuck yeah!
You better run.

38:48.478 --> 38:50.484
Next time,
I'm calling the police.

39:00.597 --> 39:01.660
Hey.

39:02.828 --> 39:04.392
I scared her off. She's not
going to coming back.

39:04.392 --> 39:06.399
What if she does?

39:06.399 --> 39:09.030
She's just some
weird teenage girl, okay?

39:09.632 --> 39:10.966
She's not gonna hurt you.

39:14.373 --> 39:15.506
You're right, you're right.

39:15.506 --> 39:17.373
I have ridden the subway
at 2:00 a.m.

39:17.373 --> 39:19.444
alone with worse, so...

39:19.444 --> 39:21.746
You've lived
to tell about it, right?

39:22.080 --> 39:23.081
Yeah.

39:23.081 --> 39:25.217
Hey, I'm starving.

39:25.217 --> 39:27.021
Wanna get something to eat?

39:27.021 --> 39:29.523
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's go.

39:57.215 --> 39:59.849
- Sounds great.
- Right?

39:59.849 --> 40:01.915

a little bit of time

40:01.915 --> 40:04.521

53:48.950 --> 53:51.513
Fuck. Right, my leg's going.

53:51.513 --> 53:53.485
I'm just going
to sit for a second.

54:20.648 --> 54:21.777
What?

54:22.345 --> 54:24.414
Can you just hold this?

54:24.414 --> 54:26.518
Watch the window,
I'll watch the door.

54:33.421 --> 54:34.757
Careful, Ry.

54:56.014 --> 54:57.084
Anything?

54:57.084 --> 54:58.814
No luck yet,
just a bunch of shit.

55:02.283 --> 55:03.720
Okay.

55:16.365 --> 55:17.565
Ryan, fuck!

55:17.565 --> 55:19.673
Fuck, Ryan!
What the fuck, Ryan!

55:21.201 --> 55:22.640
Fuck!

55:35.455 --> 55:37.116
- Come here. Come here.

55:37.852 --> 55:40.526
You're okay.
I've got you, okay?

55:41.060 --> 55:42.429
I got a shotgun.

55:44.229 --> 55:45.630
I got plenty of ammo.

56:41.621 --> 56:43.223
Did you hear that?
What is that?

56:43.223 --> 56:45.591
- One of them's on the porch.
- Fuck.

56:48.556 --> 56:50.596
- Just stay close to me.
- Okay.

57:13.020 --> 57:14.147
Ryan.

57:16.320 --> 57:17.755
Stay here, okay?

57:18.927 --> 57:20.021
I got this.

57:44.083 --> 57:45.244
I got him!

57:46.720 --> 57:48.951
What does that mean,
you got him? Did you kill him?

57:50.585 --> 57:52.386
Yeah. Yeah.

57:52.386 --> 57:55.223
Fuck. Wow, yeah.

57:55.223 --> 57:56.563
Oh, man.

58:02.069 --> 58:04.135
All right. Okay.

58:04.135 --> 58:05.302
- Ryan?
- What?

58:05.302 --> 58:06.771
Hey, where's his mask?

58:07.573 --> 58:08.905
I don't know, babe.
I don't know.

58:09.473 --> 58:10.940
There's no fucking mask.

58:26.989 --> 58:30.190
I think maybe
that's the owner, Joe.

58:31.965 --> 58:33.160
Yeah.

58:34.628 --> 58:36.031
No.

58:41.009 --> 58:43.272
Fuck. No, fuck.

58:43.272 --> 58:45.843
Fuck! Fuck!

58:51.449 --> 58:53.587
Fuck, I just killed him.

58:55.950 --> 58:57.855
You were trying to protect us.

58:57.855 --> 59:01.595
Okay? Hey. Hey, you were
trying to protect us, okay?

59:13.567 --> 59:14.905
Wait.

59:20.842 --> 59:22.716
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

59:23.452 --> 59:25.146
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Where you going?

59:32.923 --> 59:34.661
Give me the shotgun.
Give me the shotgun.

59:42.467 --> 59:44.165
Get in. Get in the car.

59:47.405 --> 59:48.675
Oh, my God!

59:56.414 --> 59:58.146
Ryan, go now!

01:00:05.687 --> 01:00:07.059
Oh, my God!

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.196
Ryan! Oh, God!

01:00:13.362 --> 01:00:15.097
Oh, my God!

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:21.466
- We're trapped, we're trapped.

01:00:21.802 --> 01:00:23.074
It's not moving.

01:00:23.074 --> 01:00:25.272

Oh, my God!

01:00:28.614 --> 01:00:31.014
- Get out. We have to get out.

01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:35.656
My leg, it's stuck. I can't.

01:00:39.087 --> 01:00:40.786
- Come on, Ryan.
- My leg is stuck.

01:00:40.786 --> 01:00:42.256
Give me your arm.

01:00:44.498 --> 01:00:46.595
You gotta go. Just go, please.

01:00:46.595 --> 01:00:48.999
I am not leaving you.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.675
I love you.
You need to go. Go!
