WEBVTT

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.920
I can't believe...

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.920
Mr. Long is really being released.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.640
Being released on medical parole
isn't true freedom yet.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800
Keep a low profile.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.080
Don't cause trouble.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.040
Follow them to the hospital.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.040
During medical parole,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.039
you must not break the law.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.719
You are not allowed
to leave or change hospitals.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.999
You are not allowed to engage
in activities...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.296
that are clearly unrelated
to medical treatment.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.359
If you are found to have violated
the aforementioned rules,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.016
your medical parole will be
terminated immediately.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.079
You will be taken back
to prison immediately...

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.120
to continue your sentence.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360
Mr. Long.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280
You...

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.520
How did this happen?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.040
Did I scare you?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.520
They're watching us very closely.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.320
If my acting is too terrible,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.000
I won't be able to fool them.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
So I was the only one
who didn't know.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.519
I'm sure you knew, Xiao Lie.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.800
That's not important.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.880
What's important is...

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.120
Dad is released.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360
Xiao Lie.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440
Thank you for everything.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.600
Keep in touch with the councilor.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.680
It's not convenient
for me to go out.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.920
Don't worry, Dad.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.319
Rest well.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.560
Focus on getting better.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.040
Come on.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.720
The old Mr. Long is back.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.200
There's no way
I'm the same as before.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.160
Even if I can fool others,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I can't fool myself.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.960
- Have you been well?
- Hello.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880
Mr. Long.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.240
Mr. Feng is here.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760
He brought flowers.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.880
He said he's here
on behalf of Councilor Huang.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.000
- I don't want to see him.
- I got it.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
I'll handle it.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720
Dad.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
Mr. Long.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.120
Don't worry. Let Xiao Lie handle it.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.760
He used to always listen to you.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.520
He's all grown up now.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.160
He knows what responsibility is.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.440
You should rest more.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.560
(Justice is Mine)

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.440
(Episode 17)

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.760
You're really punctual.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.759
You come here every day...

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.800
to have coffee at 1:15pm.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.800
Han Kui Long is out.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120
I'm sure you know.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.560
You're the one
who approved his medical parole.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.480
Also,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.119
you ruled
against the Old City District...

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.440
in the land deed case,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.000
and you ruled
Shi Zhi Yang as a corrupt cop.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.920
I don't think you would've made
these rulings before.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.480
You're completely different now.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.400
I make my rulings
based on the evidence in court.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.640
It's the same in any case.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.320
If you have new evidence,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.720
you can still appeal.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.920
I've read the A05 statement.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.960
There's not enough evidence
to appeal.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.360
Wait then.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
Perhaps in the future,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.640
there will be a different result.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.000
It takes time
to right a wrong, right?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640
I'm leaving.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160
I'm leaving too.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.200
I need to go back and find out...

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.359
why Shi Zhi Yang's killer...

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.600
confessed to killing Han Gang.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.320
Why were two clearly
unrelated cases...

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.040
linked together?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600
Losing the case...

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.120
was truly a shame.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.119
But we have to accept the fact...

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.440
that we're selling the land.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.920
What about Granduncle Chan?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.319
What did he say?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.520
Granduncle has fallen sick...

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.920
because of the land deed.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.320
Let's not bother him.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.680
The developer...

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.280
will be here the day after tomorrow.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.680
We really don't have much time left.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.360
We can just stop them
from coming in.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.480
That's right.

00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:56.121
If they dare to come in
and take our land,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.639
we'll fight them!

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.640
- That's right.
- Fight them!

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.039
- We'll fight them!
- Fight them!

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.239
- Fight them!
- Fight them!

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.639
- Fight them!
- Fight them!

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.840
- Fight them!
- Fight them!

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.240
Han Kui Long is out
on medical parole.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.800
The councilor is watching him.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.480
Han Lie won't be able
to do anything.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.680
- But we have to be prepared.
- Fight them!

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.919
Even if there's chaos here,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.520
we can't let outsiders interfere.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800
I got it.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.720
Mr. Qi, come out
and say a few words.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.240
Isn't that right?

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640
Let's fight them!

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.640
Everyone.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.560
I just want to say a few words.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.440
The government officials
and businessmen are in cahoots.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.240
We have to be united.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.599
We lost the lawsuit over the deed.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.440
And our friends were arrested
and sent to jail.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.560
But we still have
bargaining chips on hand.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.080
We haven't lost everything.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.160
We must be united.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.456
We can't let them negotiate
with us separately.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.080
Let's negotiate as a group.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.520
If you all trust me,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.480
I'll talk to the developer.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800
Qi.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.936
You're betraying
the Old City District!

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.960
That's right.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.560
I swear on my life...

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.240
that if you decide to defend
our land to the end,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.919
when the developers come in,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.320
I'll let them demolish
my house first.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.200
I won't just stay on the frontline.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.200
I'll defend it to the end.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.400
If we succeed,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.200
apart from the best price,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.640
we can even have a say...

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.720
in the future development
of the Old City District.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.800
As long as we are still here,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.480
we still hold a share
of this district!

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.200
I agree with Mr. Qi!

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.719
- Me too.
- I agree.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.160
If they want to acquire our land,
then let them do it.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.560
But this land...

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.599
was left to us
by our great-grandfather!

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.920
I'll never sell it!

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.479
- I won't sell!
- I won't sell it!

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.439
- I won't sell it!
- I won't sell it!

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.719
- Calm down.
- I won't sell!

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.399
- I won't sell it!
- Calm down!

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400
Let's talk it out.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.520
- I won't sell!
- Let them vent.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.319
Otherwise, they won't be satisfied.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.056
- After that, they'll give up.
- We won't sell!

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.840
- I'm not selling!
- I'm not selling!

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.119
- I'm never selling it.
- I'm not selling!

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.320
- I'm never selling it!
- I'm not selling it!

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600
This is Han Lie.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.999
Your dad treats
Mr. Feng like he's invisible.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.960
That kind of attitude means
he doesn't respect me.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.680
Does respecting you
put food on our table?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.160
I'm just worried about your dad.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.600
If he's in a bad mood,
I don't know what he'll do.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.240
Don't worry.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.559
I won't let my dad be in a bad mood.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.560
Okay.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.840
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.760
Dad.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.880
I bought your favorite dish.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.240
Eight Treasure Duck.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.800
Ms. Lin will bring food over later.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.759
Ms. Lin said she's not feeling well.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760
She's not coming today.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.440
- What happened to her?
- I'm not sure.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.320
But it's probably nothing.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.080
She told me to buy
whatever you want to eat.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.720
I brought food already.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You can go out and eat.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200
I'll keep my dad company.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480
Dad.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.279
You brought me and Han Gang
to eat this duck...

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.760
when we were kids.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.479
That restaurant is called Fulin.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
Do you remember?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.999
I was afraid it would be sold out,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.480
so I ordered this two days
in advance.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.680
Here.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720
Eat it while it's hot.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.160
Today, let's not drink...

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.240
red wine and brandy.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.960
Let's have some beer.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240
It'll help us relax.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480
Dad.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.480
Actually,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.040
with the elders' supervision,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.920
no one can beat us
in the drug business now.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.920
The casino's commission profits
are also very high,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.959
I've even separated...

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.200
the loan shark business.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.920
The future development
of the Old City District...

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.399
is finally your opportunity...

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.440
to turn the Han family's business
into a clean one.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.560
It will be the second
tourist gambling center.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.159
If we don't fight for it,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.800
it'll fall into
the Old City Gang's hands.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.560
Thank you, Dad.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.160
Actually, I've never forgotten...

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.120
about Han Gang's death.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800
I will...

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.800
definitely avenge him.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.520
Are you Tang Xuan?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200
Stone...

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.760
That's what we called him
since we were kids.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.640
I know you're his girlfriend.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.639
He showed me your picture.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.640
He mentioned you.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400
I'm Lin Qian.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.840
I know.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.480
He told me about you.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Can I...

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
pay my respects to Stone?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.720
I hope one day,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.920
I can send him back
to the police cemetery.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.080
I don't believe
Stone was a dirty cop.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840
It's true.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.479
He indeed helped the police...

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.640
deliver messages to Mr. Long.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920
But I know...

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.680
he never took Mr. Long's money.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.240
He was framed.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.296
He was investigating the arson case.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.880
He found out
about some shady dealings.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.919
He found out that the culprit...

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.040
was a scapegoat.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.440
There's definitely something fishy
about this case.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.120
Zhi Yang is dead now.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.120
We've hit a dead end.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.920
No wonder Stone was looking
for Liu Mao.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.000
I was the one who told him...

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.480
that Liu Mao said
he saw the real culprit.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.719
I thought...

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.016
that the culprit
had been imprisoned.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040
I even thought he died.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.840
The culprit is still out there.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.800
Stone died...

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.280
trying to find the real culprit.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.440
By the way, is there anything
I can help you with?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.200
Not unless you've also seen...

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.160
the real culprit from 20 years ago.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.760
What characteristics does he have?

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320
All I know for now...

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.480
is that he was a tall man.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.760
He had a scar
on his right shoulder...

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.640
that looked like an earthworm.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.760
(Earthworm-shaped scar
on right shoulder)

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.680
(Earthworm-shaped scar)

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720
Anyway,

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.480
thank you for coming...

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.680
to see Zhi Yang.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.760
I'm Han Kui Long's woman.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.040
I'm grateful...

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.160
that you and Stone
didn't despise me.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.480
Qin Yu caused my brother's death.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.920
So, I harmed his son.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.400
This is what's called tit for tat.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.720
Both he and his son must die.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.200
But not now.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.320
Our loved ones suffer,

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.680
while our enemies rejoice.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.040
This deserves a drink.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.560
Dad, do you know what?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.240
In the past, when you
and Han Gang were around,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.079
no matter what you did,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.320
I would always support you.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.120
I completely believed in you.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.440
But it's different now.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.880
Han Gang is gone.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.520
You're the only one left.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320
No matter what,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.360
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.720
I know.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.120
I'm not as capable as Han Gang.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.200
But I'll try my best.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.960
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.200
But can you give me some time?

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.320
Even if it's just a little bit.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.600
Can you trust me?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.040
You're right.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.320
Your brother is dead.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.640
You're my only son now.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.000
Prove yourself to your brother.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.320
Fulfill my wish.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120
Yes, Dad.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.400
Come here.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600
You're dodging?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.920
Let's go in.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.160
This guy is so unlucky.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.120
His older brother
owed someone money,

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.640
but he's dead now.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.576
So, the little brother
has to pay the debt.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.039
He has an extra debt to pay now.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.080
Of course, that's unlucky.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.560
He's not as unlucky
as his cousin, Ma Shan Bao.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.080
Ma Shan Bao?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.920
What do they want?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.400
He has to pay his debts, of course.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.920
They asked him to help
with their deliveries.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280
That kid...

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.640
He's too chicken to do it.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.320
Look at how
he's getting beaten up now.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.920
You're the only one here...

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.640
who doesn't have to be afraid.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.240
You have a judge for a dad.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.960
No one dares to touch you.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.920
Hey. Tell them to stop hitting him.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.680
Stop?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.320
- I'll do the deliveries for them.
- What?

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.520
Are you serious?

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.840
Yes.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040
You're crazy.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.520
Here's the deal.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880
That kid over there...

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.600
His dad is a judge.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880
My client...

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080
is innocent.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.880
The shooting victim was
an 18-year-old male...

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.200
from the Old City District,
Ma Shan Bao.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200
It's done.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.320
Take it back to the cell.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.800
Wait for me to come and find you.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.400
Aren't you the son
of a prestigious judge?

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840
Look at him.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.800
He got knocked down so easily.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720
Get up.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.960
You're so useless.

00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:59.399
- I'll beat you to death.
- What are you doing?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.040
- Behave yourselves.
- Watch out.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.240
Forget it.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400
Let's go.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800
Are you okay?

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.800
- I'm fine.
- Stop right there.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.760
Did he really do it?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.240
When he heard
it was Ma Shan Bao's cousin,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.160
how could he not do it?

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.320
How did you hurt your arm?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.760
I'm fine.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560
Stop right there!

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040
Why are you so scared?

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.120
Is someone bullying you?

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800
No.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.800
You can tell us
if someone is bullying you.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.200
The warden told us
to take good care of you.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Let's go.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920
I was just careless.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.880
I know it's not easy in here.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.360
Even though I'm out here,

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.600
I tell myself every day...

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.720
that this will end one day.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640
Son.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.040
Hang in there.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.440
I brought you some books.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040
It's okay.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.520
Grandma already brought me a lot.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
Yes.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.400
Grandma and I both think...

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.480
you should study a bit now.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.760
When you get out of prison,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.600
you can take university courses.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800
Dad.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.560
If Ma Shan Bao didn't die,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.880
would he have been able
to go to university too?

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.000
Why do you say that?

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.320
Sometimes,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.520
I think of his face.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.040
Shouldn't we move on?

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160
In here,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
they all call me...

00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:15.240
the judge's son.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920
Actually,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.720
I'm just like them.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720
I'm a prisoner.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.440
Dad.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.360
I'm all grown up now.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.840
I can take care of myself.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.399
A knife scar...

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.360
that looks like an earthworm?

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.200
It's obvious
that he'd have gotten stitches.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.879
So you're asking,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.159
if he really went to the hospital...

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.000
for treatment,

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520
would anyone remember?

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520
That's right.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.520
Come on, Tang Xuan.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.600
You're talking about 20 years ago.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.719
I know I can't go
to all the hospitals...

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.880
and go through their records
from 20 years ago.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.320
But I can ask around.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.240
With your connections,

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.920
I might really be able to find out.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.120
There could be a doctor or nurse...

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.920
who performed
this kind of surgery...

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.040
and happens to remember that person.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.680
Is this evidence important?

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.320
It could be evidence...

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.840
that can overturn Shek's case.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720
I got it.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.880
I'll look into it for you.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.216
Your blood pressure is a bit high.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.360
You can't drink anymore.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.840
I'm on medical parole.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.800
I have to find some illness
for you to treat.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.400
Mr. Long, get some rest.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.680
Mr. Long.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.280
Aren't you unwell?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.056
I'll tell the doctor to come back
and check on you.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.240
I'm fine, Mr. Long.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.360
Yesterday was my brother's
death anniversary.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.320
He was only six when he died.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.640
It's all in the past.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.560
Don't think about it.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.120
But when I see you,

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.800
I can't help but think about it.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.360
What do you mean?

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.920
Twenty years ago, there was a fire
in the Wooden Shed Area.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.160
My whole family died.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.480
But that night,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.920
I met you.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.279
I still remember it.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.880
Back then, you were squatting
on the side of the road.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.920
You were out of it.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.320
Your eyes were swollen from crying.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.160
Mr. Long.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.360
You're not
from the Wooden Shed Area.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.120
Why were you there that night?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.720
It's because
I was meant to meet you.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
Mr. Long.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.199
I found this leather jacket.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200
Do you remember it?

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.279
The night I met you,

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.720
you were wearing
this leather jacket.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
You still have it?

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.760
It has sentimental value.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.640
Let me see if it still fits.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.960
I can still wear it.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.160
It still fits well.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.360
Mr. Long.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.480
You and Xiao Lie...

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.440
are the only family I have now.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.120
Do you have anything to tell me?

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.800
Yes.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800
Thank you so much...

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.600
for taking care of my sons...

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.320
for the past 20 years.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400
Also,

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880
what do you want to eat?

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.000
I'll get someone to buy it for you.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.759
(Shi Zhi Yang)

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.360
(Huyan Wooden Shed Arson Case,
September 3, 1978, 104 deceased...)

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.360
Luo Qiang.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.880
You've been with me
for 20 years, right?

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.400
21 years.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.600
We're going to chat here.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320
You guys go over there.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.000
I can't believe it.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.240
I can't even order...

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.600
my subordinates around.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.240
It's Young Master Lie's order.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.920
We are to protect you at all times.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.720
Do you take orders from him...

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.600
or me?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.480
Don't be nervous.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.759
With you by Xiao Lie's side,

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.040
I don't have to worry.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.280
Mr. Long.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.240
No matter what,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.480
I'll always do as you say.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.400
It's good that
Xiao Lie is doing well.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.880
Even if he takes over...

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.520
the Han family,

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.200
I have no objections.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.480
The Han family
will continue to prosper.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.040
But my son is dead.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.320
Someone must pay for it.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.800
That judge must die.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.400
I know what to do.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.960
I'll be the only one
who knows about this.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.840
Officer Hu.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.880
Can you respect my privacy?

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.919
If I didn't respect your privacy,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.800
I would've publicly
shamed you already.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040
What did I do?

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.720
Two hospitals complained to me.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.120
They said you were
obstructing their work.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.599
I only obstructed them...

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.720
for a minute or two at most.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.760
When they heard
it was a police inquiry,

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.999
they felt pressured...

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.120
and disturbed.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.200
Then please help me tell them...

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.520
that from the bottom of my heart,

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.280
I truly apologize.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.880
What you're doing...

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.880
is like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080
There's a difference.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.959
Because if I do it,

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.159
I'll have a better chance.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.199
Okay, then you must
handle this discreetly.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.440
Don't alert Da Gama.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520
Officer Da.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.919
These are freshly baked egg tarts.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.480
Mr. Long hasn't had them
in a long time.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.120
You even brought coffee.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.440
Egg tarts and coffee
are the perfect match.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.759
They're not as perfect
as you and Mr. Long.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.760
Mr. Long.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.319
Officer Da brought
egg tarts and coffee.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.360
Put them here.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.679
Mr. Long, I'll leave you two alone.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.440
- I'll get going.
- Be careful.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360
Let's sit over there.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.840
You know she's an orphan,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.136
but you're still keeping her
by your side.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160
Mr. Long.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.640
You have good taste.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.399
Let's not talk about such nonsense.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400
What do you want?

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.280
I just envy you.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Back then,

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.319
thanks to you burning down
the Wooden Shed Area,

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.440
we were able to seek fortune
through this risk.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.480
Who knew...

00:30:23.481 --> 00:30:24.759
that your biggest gain from it...

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.920
would be becoming a Casanova?

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.920
Cut the crap.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.880
Just get to the point.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120
It's like this.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.519
The Wooden Shed Area fire...

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.736
is the bargaining chip that gave us
our first pot of gold.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.760
This chip...

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.399
can be exchanged
for the future profits...

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.920
of the Old City District's
development.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.480
It's our harvest season
for wealth and riches.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.280
After that,

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.919
we can enjoy
our golden years in peace.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920
Isn't that good?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.520
It's great.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.160
Then stop fixating on the judge.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640
Besides,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.840
you only got out...

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.680
because he approved it.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.400
Should I thank him then?

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.560
Your son is already dead.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.359
Even if you kill him
a thousand times,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.840
it won't bring
your son back to life.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.440
I've said all there is to say.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.080
Don't be too stubborn.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.600
Lastly,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.880
they have someone backing them up.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.920
You'd better watch out.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.840
I'm not afraid of them!

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.080
Tang Xuan.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.519
A retired head nurse...

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.576
just came back to visit us.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.720
I talked to her for a while.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.320
I think she has seen
that person before.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.200
Back then,

00:31:39.201 --> 00:31:40.720
I was a nurse in the ER.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.120
When that man came in,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.640
half of his body
was covered in blood.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.000
The stab wound was long and deep.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.240
It required dozens of stitches.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.360
It was because of him...

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.200
that my family couldn't
celebrate my birthday with me.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.720
That's why I remember it clearly.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.800
When is your birthday?

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.480
September 3rd, 1978.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.520
September 3rd, 1978.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.440
(Han Kui Long)

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.160
(Date of Admission:
September 3, 1978)

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.920
Dad.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.760
Ms. Lin made this soup for you.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.440
She suddenly had something to do.

00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:43.720
She said she'd come over later.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520
She told me...

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.496
that you must drink this soup
while it's hot.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.120
It'll lose its nutrients
if it gets cold.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280
Here, drink it.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.640
Mr. Long, I'm about to do it.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880
Wait to hear from me.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.240
Next time,

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.920
just ask someone to deliver it.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.120
Use more of your time on work.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.160
It's not easy to head
the Han family.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.840
No matter how much I do,

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.520
or how much effort I put in,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.920
in your heart,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.640
will I never be as good as Han Gang?

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.200
You never believed in me.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.800
You didn't believe
that I would avenge Han Gang.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.839
Even if it costs us
the entire Han family...

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.320
and everyone else,

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.440
you still insist
on avenging him now.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.320
Can't you wait?

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.760
Even Luo Qiang betrayed me.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.840
It's because Mr. Qiang
is most loyal to you...

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.800
that he doesn't want you
to go back to prison.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.080
You're all grown up now, aren't you?

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.400
As long as I'm here,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.400
I'm the one
in charge of the Han family!

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.319
You have no right
to tell me what to do!

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.680
Dad! Han Gang is dead.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.120
I'm still alive.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.639
Am I not your son?

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.280
If you're my son,
you should listen to me!

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.400
Your brother
never disobeyed with me.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640
You!

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.920
You always act on your own!

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.080
I said I'd avenge him!

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.520
But when I do it...

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.720
is up to me.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.840
It's up to me! You...

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.960
You...

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.440
No matter how you see me,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.000
I can't watch my own father...

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.200
die in prison.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.576
We found the real arsonist
of the Wooden Shed Area Arson Case.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600
It's Han Kui Long.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.880
With new evidence,
the case can be retried.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.200
If we catch Han Kui Long,

00:36:39.201 --> 00:36:41.039
he can testify that
the one who paid off Liu Mao...

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040
was Da Gama.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320
Once Da Gama is convicted,

00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:44.920
we can clear Shi Zhi Yang's name.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160
Calm down first.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.880
We can't be too impulsive.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.800
We have to plan it well.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.240
We especially can't let
anyone know about this.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.319
I mentioned to Lin Qian...

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.520
that the culprit has a scar.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.600
I've arranged for someone...

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.600
to smuggle Dad to a country
without an extradition agreement.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.720
Even if the police find out,

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.440
they can't do anything.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.120
This medicine
will only make him sleep.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.720
He'll be fine when he wakes up.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.080
Please take care of Dad.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640
After you get there...

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040
and get settled in,

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.960
I'll go and apologize
to him in person.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.400
Does your relationship
really have to come to this?

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.840
I'm going to check
if everything is ready.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.800
Someone will see you off later.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.320
Pack your things.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360
Ms. Lin.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.840
The boat will arrive in two hours.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.040
It will take you and Mr. Long
to the Philippines.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.280
Everything has been arranged.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.200
Go and have dinner.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.680
Buy a bowl of seafood congee
for Mr. Long later.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.160
Feed it to him when he wakes up.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.160
Come back soon.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.760
We'll be back as soon as possible.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480
You did this...

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.280
to save my dad.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.200
Suffering a little unfairness...

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.560
is not a big deal.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.480
The most important thing is...

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.120
to keep my dad alive.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.440
Only if my dad leaves...

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.360
can he have real freedom.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.120
Actually, Mr. Long...

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.360
is indeed biased
toward Young Master Gang.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760
But he...

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.520
isn't unreasonable.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.360
I asked you to leave with my dad.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880
Why are you staying?

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.920
I'm staying for the Han family.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.920
Dad would be happy to hear that.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240
Because he didn't lose.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040
Young Master Lie.

00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:36.256
Someone is looking for Ms. Lin.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280
Who is it?

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.640
A policewoman named Tang.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.680
Madam.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.216
Why are you looking for me
in the middle of the night?

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.600
I'm not here to see you.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.079
Are you looking for Lin Qian...

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.400
for business or personal reasons?

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.640
I don't have to answer to you.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.000
I won't get in the way
of you looking for her.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.120
But this is my home.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
You're not welcome here.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.920
If there's an emergency,

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520
wake him up.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.960
What's going on?

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.840
I know you're the one...

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.120
who set fire
to the Wooden Shed Area back then.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.240
Back then, thanks to you
burning down the Wooden Shed Area,

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.640
we were able to seek fortune
through this risk.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.880
You're the one
who killed my parents...

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.880
and my little brother.
