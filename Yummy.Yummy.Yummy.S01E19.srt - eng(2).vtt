00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.340
(Windfall)

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.580
(Longevity and Prosperity,
Promotion and Salary Increase)

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.860
Young Master.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.940
Young Master.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.500
Young Master.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.980
Third Master Liu has come to visit.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.390
(Windfall)
He is currently talking

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.620
with Lady Shen in the garden.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.020
I see.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.180
That's it?

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.420
Why don't you go eavesdrop?

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.860
Why should I go?

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.940
Stop carving that.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.340
Anyway, the Princess will

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.980
give us Prince Consort Xiao's box.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.140
It's very easy

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.100
to pick its lock.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.900
The current emergency

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.820
is Third Master Liu
coming to pursue love.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.900
Lady Shen decides entirely on her own

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.800
whom she wishes to meet

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.020
or not meet.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.350
It's none of my business.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.460
Young Master,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.460
can you stop pretending?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.660
Your thoughts are completely
transparent.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.620
The clothes that Lady Shen gave you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900
are folded so preciously like that.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.490
And this cushion that she gave you.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.420
Look.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.900
You won't even let me touch it.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.380
And that cup.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.260
You hold it carefully all day long.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.550
(Eat on time)
Even if I'm dull,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.580
I can still tell

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.580
you like her.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.460
I'm so anxious.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.960
I am the only grandson in the family.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.500
And I'm still not married.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.860
Only then would my grandpa be so abrupt

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.640
as to come to propose marriage
uninvited.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.140
He was anxious

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.580
and misunderstood your intentions.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.980
I won't take it to heart.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.580
Although

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.680
the matter of my grandpa
coming to propose marriage

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.480
was not within my expectations,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.060
well,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.020
I hope you could

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.380
keep this proposal in mind.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.540
These words

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.220
should have been spoken
by an official matchmaker

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.940
only after everything was prepared.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.140
But now

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.390
I have no choice
but to shamelessly speak for myself.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.840
I am 25 years old this year.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.990
My ancestors have been people of Yong'an
for generations.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.180
My family is in business.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.020
Apart from the Guixiang Tavern
on Juxian Alley,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.540
there are also 75 estates,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.780
98 residential compounds,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.340
and 632 shops.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.980
You are so rich.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.500
(Wait!)

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.900
(That smile?)

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.840
(Could it mean...)

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.760
(Lady,)

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.660
(are you satisfied
with everything you see?)

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.820
What I'm saying

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.360
is by no means a momentary impulse.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.580
I hope

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.020
you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.060
can consider carefully

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.260
the matter between you and me.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.700
Why do you want to marry me?

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.060
You are naturally intelligent.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.460
And your business skills

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.100
are the best I have ever seen
in my life.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.740
You and I were meant to join forces.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.940
If we get married,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.460
the alliance will be
even more lasting and stable.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.980
We are a good fit.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.140
That's it?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.980
You should be able to see

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.460
that I am not a pedantic person.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.940
In ordinary families,
the husband works outside

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.000
and the wife stays at home.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.180
I just want to face the storms

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.740
together with my wife.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.540
You are eloquent

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.380
and tactful.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.980
Of course we are a perfect match.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.420
The bond between you and me

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.980
is the alliance between Guixiang Tavern

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.180
and your family's eatery.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.340
Shaoguang,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.500
when we graduate,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.620
you won't have to go back

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.100
to your family's restaurant every day.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.820
In the future,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.770
I'll earn money to support the family

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.460
and you find a stable job

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.500
to take care of the family.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.780
I will treat you well.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.980
Shen Shaoguang,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.060
I have a good job now.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.780
We are not compatible.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.620
If you leave on your own,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.290
you can still leave a good impression.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.490
It's you who force me to say it,
making it look so bad.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.220
You're too immature.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.460
Mr. Liu,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.620
sorry, I cannot agree.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.020
You come from a distinguished family

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.140
and have upright conduct.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.900
You are really a rare
and excellent person.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.200
But my view on marriage

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.180
is quite different from yours.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.300
Lady Shen,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.420
no need to look for excuses so quickly.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.620
I understand.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.660
It happened suddenly.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.580
But you and I are indeed a good match.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.620
How about this?

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.860
You take a few more days
to think it over.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.660
Sorry, I've already made up my mind.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.900
Mr. Liu, wait a moment.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.550
Last time, your grandpa left
in a hurry.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.190
didn't have time
to return the pastries.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.550
I will go and fetch it right away.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.620
Mr. Lin.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.820
Why are you here, Mr. Lin?

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.980
This is my home.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200
It's quite normal for me

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.020
to passed by, I guess.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.500
Mr. Liu,

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.060
it was already late.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.100
The garden is also large.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.140
The road is hard to find.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.620
I'll see you out.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.580
See you.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.620
This way.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.860
Please.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.940
Let's go.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.780
This way.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.860
- I just turned him down.
- I'm taking a walk.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.570
- Nothing else.
- Nothing else.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.420
A walk?

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.780
A walk?

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.620
It's good.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.020
OK, take a walk.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.820
Wait a minute.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.140
Mr. Lin.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.740
What's wrong with your hands?

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.140
Winter is coming soon.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.500
I wash dishes with cold water.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.990
It's inevitable for hands to turn red.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.480
Unfortunately, this is Yong'an.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.360
It would be great if we were
in Future Village.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.420
There is a machine called a dishwasher.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.760
It can wash dishes automatically.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.180
In this way, when winter comes,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.420
I don't need to touch cold water

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.060
and my hands won't get frostbite.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.980
Dishwasher?

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.780
What is it like?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.420
It's just a square-shaped metal one.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.260
And...

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.820
Let me draw it for you.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.340
Like this.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.940
It's roughly like this.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.180
Here,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.140
there is a pipe that can draw water
by itself.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.180
There's also a pipe here.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.340
It's for drainage.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.420
There's water flowing here.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.020
It can flush automatically.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.300
Just like that, it washes the dishes
by itself.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.860
This thing is really amazing.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.340
But

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.420
how does it work on its own?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.500
This thought from you

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.780
drives people toward the Future Village.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.900
Yong'an does not have this condition.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.380
It still requires manual operation.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.820
Do you really like this dishwasher?

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.140
We didn't have money at home before.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.500
We couldn't afford a dishwasher.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.860
I thought I need to grow up quickly

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.980
and earn money to buy one.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.380
Then I finally grew up
and started making money.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.980
I bought a dishwasher.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.940
But I came to Yong'an,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.880
and ended up never being able to use it.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.100
I feel quite upset about it.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.660
However, my family all think

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.260
it's just a dishwasher.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.020
How could I stay unhappy for so long?

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.770
You always wanted it
when you were little,

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.440
but never got it.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.500
It will lead to particularly
deep obsession.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.860
And

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.520
it's not that you've never had it;

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.760
it's that you once possessed it

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.700
and then lost it.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.360
Of course you would feel sadder.

I have figured it out.

I am fond of Shen Shaoguang.

you have finally figured it out.

That's great.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.020

does not like you?

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.340

I've always said I want to treat you.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.140
But it's always been you treating me.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.580
I really feel bad about this.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.340

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.820
To be honest with you,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.600
I invited you to dinner today

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.300
because I have a favor to ask.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.660
Anran, just speak your mind.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.300
I want you to arrange a meeting

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.860
with the Princess.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.060
You are making things difficult for me.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.860
You should know the Princess and I...

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.580
I am your friend.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.820
Why do you help the Princess instead?

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.540
In fact,

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.660
I also feel very sorry.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.900
I have something important

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.300
to ask the Princess for help.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.100
But only by asking for your help

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.760
can this matter be handled smoothly.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.150
I truly have no other way.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.500
If you are willing to lend a hand,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.090
I will do my utmost to repay you.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.230
Please.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.340
Alright.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.240
In fact,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.620
since we got to know each other,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.060
you have truly

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.660
helped me a lot.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.700
I owe you this.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.190

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.260

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.700
although we haven't known each other
for long,

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.500
I can vaguely sense

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.260
that you seem to have some secrets.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.420
But Anran, rest assured.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.760
I won't press you with questions.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.180
please feel free to speak.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.900
I am willing to risk my life

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.860
and draw my sword

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.830
to help you.

Here you are. Please have a seat.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.100
Are you proficient in chess games?

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.580
Slightly knowledgeable.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.980
But not skilled in it.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.950
Your Highness,

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.890
you are asking me to play chess.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.100
Then let's have a game.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.180
The winner can ask the loser a question.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.020
How about it?

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.780
I lost.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.460
According to the rules,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.340
I will ask you a question.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.240
Your Highness, please.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.660
Listen.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.860
Do you like

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.580
cats or dogs?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.940
Maybe cats.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.580
Next round.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.170
That's it?

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.380
Only this?

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.340
Actually, when I was little,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.860
I raised a cat

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.580
named Erliang.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.260
Later, my cousin lost it.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.380
But my cousin

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.780
was unwilling to apologize to me for it.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.060
In his eyes,

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.980
that cat is just as insignificant

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.180
as I am.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.180
From then,

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.820
I studied hard.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.660
I must stand out and succeed.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.540
But I am far too mediocre

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.860
by nature,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.860
and gradually

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.220
I have also accepted my mediocrity.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.380
But...

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.140
But I was never able

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.580
to find my cat.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.300
I lost.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.740
Your Highness, please ask.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.660
May I ask

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.420
who is the person you cherish the most
in the world?

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.540
It is my mother.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.260
My father died young.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.220
My mother raised me alone.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.520
From the very first day
I arrived in the capital,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.620
I swore

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.660
that once my salary increases,

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.260
I'll bring her to the capital

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.260
and live with me.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.340
But it's been all these years.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.340
They have never given me a raise.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.420
I admit defeat.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.940
Your Highness, please ask.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.580
Who is the person you hate the most?

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.140
That's a lot more.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.940
For example, my cousin who lost Erliang.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.860
The uncle who said that my mother
restrained her husband.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.420
And...

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.380
Anyway, there are so many

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.980
that I can't even list them all.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.220
From small matters to big ones,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.180
I know everything

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.740
about you.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.420
I just want to ask

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.500
if you have ever had any regrets.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.420
Of course there is.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:12.860
For example,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.100
the Qixi poetry gathering.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.900
No, no.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.980
No, no, no.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.420
Your Highness, please forgive me.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.480
Your Highness, forgive me.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.980
Could it be that I win?

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.700
I win, don't I?

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.300
Congratulations.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.900
According to the rules,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.740
you may ask me a question.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.580
Then I shall ask the question

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.460
that you just asked me.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.220
Is there anything

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.580
that makes you feel regret?

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.180
I

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.660
regret marrying Fifth Master Xiao.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.540
Since then, nothing has gone
as I wished.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.980
As a princess,

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.980
I have no regrets.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.060
But as Li Ruxin,

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.580
I am not happy.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.460
My father, for the sake
of his own sense of loyalty

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.220
and also so that Mr. Xiao

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.300
could better assist my brother,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.860
married me to Fifth Master Xiao.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.180
Fifth Master Xiao had his own lover.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.260
We are just a pair of pitiable people.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.140
Less than half a month
after our marriage,

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.860
he fell from his horse by accident.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.900
I could have poisoned him to death.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.300
But I think he's a poor guy.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.180
From then, I have to waste
the good years

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.140
wasting in taking care

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.220
of a person who is in deep sleep,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.380
never to be free
for the rest of my life.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.340
I didn't expect it to be this late.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.060
Mr. Pei,

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.780
why not leave after having the meal?

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.220
Forget it.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.500
I overstepped.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.780
It's enough to confine me alone.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.420
Why trouble you to accompany me?

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.620
Your Highness,

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.340
I'd better leave after having the meal.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.740
We're friends.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.340
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.780
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.540
Last night,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.940
I had a delightful conversation

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.220
with Mr. Pei.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.780
Last... last night?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.740
Mr. Lin,

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.860
the belongings of the Prince Consort

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.260
(Pure and Noble)
are all stored here.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.140
The wooden slips you are looking for

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.460
to settle the case are right in here.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.620
But

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.180
the lock on that box is rather peculiar.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.020
I don't have the key either.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.900
See if you can open it.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.220
How could this be?

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.380
This...

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.580
Your Highness,

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.460
the edges of the palm print

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.160
on the lid of this box
are extremely clear

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.760
and have not been covered by new dust.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.780
It seems the thief

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.860
has just stolen the slips.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.340
The residence is heavily guarded.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.100
It is difficult for thieves to sneak in.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.860
At that time, the Prince Consort
always carried the key with him.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.460
After he had an accident,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.020
the key also went missing.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.420
Could it be that the Prince Consort Xiao
has woken up?

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.780
You freak me out.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.180
I thought you had really woken up.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.900
I didn't mean it that way.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.540
I also hope

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.020
that he will recover soon.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.820
Your Highness,

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.460
in my opinion,

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.100
there may be a traitor in the mansion.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.100
They even dare to cause trouble
in my place.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.820
Once caught, I'll strip them.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.740
Someone.
Report to the Capital Prefecture.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.100
Your Highness,

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.940
I am already here.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.260
No need for that.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.500
Indeed.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.340
Your Highness,

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.860
since there is a traitor...

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.220
Why did this traitor

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.820
not steal gold, silver, or jewels,

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.260
only took away
the Prince Consort's slips?

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.860
Why did he take that useless thing?

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.700
It's useless to you,

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.260
but not necessarily for others.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.360
Lately,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.280
are there any unfamiliar faces
in your mansion?

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.000
Ever since I met with Mr. Pei,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.990
it's been a long time
since any newcomers joined.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.360
Even quite a few of the original ones
have been dismissed.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.740
They are all official servants.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.190
Even when establishing the residence,

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:23.480
the military must be registered.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.280
It's impossible to leave
without permission.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.860
The thief just acted.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.180
Most likely, former subordinates
have taken bribes

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.460
and betrayed to do this.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.420
Your Highness,

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.140
better to find an excuse

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.540
to temporarily seal off the gates.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:38.940
OK.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.540
Are you concerned

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.060
that suddenly sealing off the residence

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.700
might cause public criticism?

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.900
That's not the case.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.260
It's just that

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.780
the Shen family introduced a hotpot
with dregs vinegar.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.780
I was planning to go eat it.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.700
Now I can't have it.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.700
The attendant Liu beside you

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.000
should be trustworthy, right?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.380
Why not send him out of the mansion

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.660
and invite Lady Shen?

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.500
What's this new thing?

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.980
How interesting!

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.100
Your Highness,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.320
this is a newly developed snack

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.460
by my family,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.860
called candied hawthorn.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.580
Candied hawthorn?

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.300
This... this is sugar?

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.100
It is syrup made by boiling sugar.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.660
You can actually make sugar

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.500
as thin and crisp as ice,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.740
still wrapped with hawthorn.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.020
Glad you like it.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.560
Hawthorn aids digestion and the spleen.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.050
Rock sugar promotes saliva production.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.500
We also plan to make more varieties

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.480
and sell them at the stall
outside the restaurant.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.220
If you like it,

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.460
I will send some more later.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.460
Alright, alright.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.300
Your Highness.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.060
Have you found out anything?

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.460
The fingerprint on the box

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.500
is about seven inches long,

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.430
about three inches wide.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.270
It can be calculated

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.300
the thief is likely a man,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.540
standing over six feet tall.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.990
There are at least a dozen people

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.700
in the mansion

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.300
who are six feet tall.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.100
Lady Shen, don't panic.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.340
There was a burglary
in the mansion today.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.420
One of the Prince Consort's boxes
was damaged.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.940
The things inside were stolen.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.900
In order to catch the thief,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.860
I've ordered the gate to be locked

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.020
and gathered everyone together.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.620
As a result, no one is serving me now.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.900
I'm afraid you couldn't leave for now.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.780
It doesn't matter.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.620
You enjoy the food from our family.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.220
We couldn't be happier.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.180
But I just heard you say

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.860
there are more than a dozen suspects.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.980
This is hard to find him out.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.780
Apart from the handprint on the box,

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.120
were there any fingerprints left?

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.500
Fingerprint?

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.860
What are you doing?

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.900
Your Highness,

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.380
I'm taking fingerprints.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.260
It was discovered
in the previous dynasty

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.060
that the patterns
on each person's fingers

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.000
are divided into whorls and loops.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.830
Contracts and documents often

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.390
use fingerprint stamps for endorsement.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.620
Those patterns can thus be used

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.990
to distinguish everyone's identity.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.700
You just said

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.550
this box has not been touched
for a long time.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.660
After discovering the theft,

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.620
none of you have touched the lock on it.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.820
Then these fingerprints on it

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.140
must belong to the same person.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.900
I got it.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.860
Here they are.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.180
Today, the Crown Prince
paid a sudden visit.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.500
For the sake of his safety,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.380
the mansion will be temporarily closed.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.820
Her Highness considers
the inconveniences for you,

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.920
so she grants each person
one string of coins.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.020
Come on.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.480
Line up one by one to take the money.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.240
(List)
Put a fingerprint after receiving it.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.890
So I can give an account
to Her Highness.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.660
Li Sheng.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.500
Here.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.060

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.220
Here.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.260

(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.550
His Highness has other official duties.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.900
He can't come today.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.280
The mansion gate is already open.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.380
Everyone, please feel free.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.700
Hurry, hurry.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.580
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.580
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:33.780
Your Highness,

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.620
please review.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.380
(Conduct oneself with great elegance)

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.400
(Associate with gentlemen)

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.300
This handwriting is different.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.820
The wooden slips are fake.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.500
I...

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.300
I personally took them from the box

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.540
where Prince Consort Xiao

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.540
kept wooden slips.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.900
After you stole them,

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.140
did you immediately left the mansion?

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.180
I was worried about arousing suspicion,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.200
so I planned to take advantage
of the shift change

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:04.990
to leave there.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.860
Who would have thought

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.820
Her Highness,
due to the Crown Prince's visit,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.240
closed the gates in the afternoon.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.980
I have kept the slips hidden
in the room all along.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.820
When the gate opens,

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.620
I hurried back to Sushui City.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.580
The Crown Prince has truly gone there?

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.540
No.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.780
But...

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.660
But the Crown Prince is close
to the Princess.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.600
He comes if he wants to,

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.150
and doesn't come if he doesn't want to.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.380
It doesn't seem unusual at all.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.340
It seems

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.940
Anran has already found out.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.460
Young Master, you truly
have remarkable foresight.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.180
You used that excuse
to send away that servant.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.700
(The Case of Fan Lüe)
I went into his room to search.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.760
(The facts are clear and undeniable)
I really found these slips.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.180
And then I followed what you said

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.380
and swapped them with forged ones.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.660
There're many doubts about the case

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.020
of selling official positions.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.100
Liu Chang,

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.840
Fifth Master Xiao really recorded it.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.940
No wonder they wanted to steal them.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.900
They have been sending people
to watch us.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.460
Because I am close to the Princess.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.760
They are afraid of being exposed.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
So they had to act rashly

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.440
to steal from the Princess's mansion.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.780
So that means

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.540
there must be other clues here.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.620
Keep looking.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.980
(... injured someone.
Prefect Cui...)

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.370
(The Case of Heluo Wang Kejiu)

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.620
Young Master,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.460
why is there nothing written here?

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.640
Fifth Master Xiao had originally
written something here.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.660
It seems he wiped it off.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.980
But he was very hesitant,

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.580
so it wasn't wiped clean.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.100
The outlines of the characters

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.300
can still be vaguely seen.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.460
Cui Yong...

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.580
The friend...

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:18.980
Of...

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.060
What...

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.860
Actually...

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.380
This is all crooked and messy.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.340
I can't make out anything at all.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.540
Cui Ning's old friend, Second Master,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.560
had originally argued strongly for him,

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.100
but after one night,

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.580
he suddenly changed his stance.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.860
Your eyesight is amazing.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.700
Second Master?

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.020
Does Mr. Cui have a friend
ranked second?

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.620
Is there?

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.460
Among the disciples of my father,

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.100
there is indeed one who ranks second.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:01.860
I found out from this person,

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.760
the sworn brother of the son
of the second aunt

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.600
of the cousin of the wife
of the third brother

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.990
of that Aunt Ge, who delivers fish.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:07.980
The one who is a guard.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:09.020
He said that 20 years ago,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.300
Zhao Xunzhi was a disciple
of the Capital Prefect.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.780
Zhao Xunzhi?

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.580
(Second Master suddenly
changed his stance overnight.)

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.700
This is a dishwasher?

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.740
(Shen's Diner)

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.560
If you hadn't helped me
verify the fingerprint,

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.400
and find the culprit,

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.500
I definitely can't

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.780
retrieve the things in that box.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.600
To express my gratitude,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.860
I want to give you a gift.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.240
A dishwasher?

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:39.860
What is it like?

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.100
How about this?

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.140
Let me draw it for you.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.900
Here, it has a tube.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.100
It can draw water on its own.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.220
There's also a pipe here.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.220
It's for drainage.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.340
There's water flowing here.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.900
It can flush automatically.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.140
You really made it.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.260
I was just speaking casually.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.820
That night,

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:02.740
you drew simply,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.800
and didn't say much either.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.300
I thought it over and over,

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.330
but I still don't know how

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.680
to make it operate automatically.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.460
I had to settle for the next best thing,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.380
and made a hand-cranked drum.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.940
Want to give it a try?

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.100
I just got a few plates

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.100
from the lobby.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.220
This is the water valve.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.780
Give it a try.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.850
It really can wash dishes.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.020
Of course.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.620
It must take you a long time

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.780
to make this machine.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.740
It didn't delay your proper work, right?

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.740
No.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.900
It's easy.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.350
It didn't cause any delay.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.220
Was this injury

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.220
caused by using the dishwasher?

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.980
It's not.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.140
I got scratched accidentally

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.740
while fixing a chair
in Capital Prefecture.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.660
It has nothing to do
with the dishwasher.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.540
As a Capital Prefect,

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.500
you even have to fix the chair yourself?

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.860
Yes.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.180
I just

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.220
don't want to trouble others.

Shaoguang,

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.140
do you care about me

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.820
at least a little in your heart?

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.100
I don't.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.340
Not at all?

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.300
Not at all.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.140
I never...

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:45.860
Excuse me.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.380
How much are the candied hawthorns?

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.180
