WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.840
I finally found a loophole.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.720
All this time,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.880
he has been exploiting people's habitual memory.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800
Madam.

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:09.919
There were too many customers yesterday.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.920
I was swamped.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.920
I shortchanged you two dollars.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.120
I'll give it back to you now.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960
It's okay.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.280
You did shortchange me two dollars.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.520
But it wasn't yesterday.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.840
It was the day before yesterday.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Really?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
During this time,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.639
Qin Yu always goes...

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.080
Mr. Fei's coffee shop at 1:15pm to buy coffee.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.600
Over time,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.279
in Mr. Fei's mind,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.880
this habitual memory formed.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.959
So even if Qin Yu...

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.039
didn't show up or was late...

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.480
for a day or two,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680
Mr. Fei...

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:43.960
wouldn't remember it clearly.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
Later,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360
Qin Yu deliberately left a ring behind...

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.280
to mislead Mr. Fei's memory.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.839
He wanted Mr. Fei to think...

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.320
that on the day he found the ring,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.160
Qin Yu had actually been there.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.960
But that ring...

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.080
was left behind by Qin Yu earlier.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.480
He used it to forge his alibi.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.640
That makes sense.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.680
But it's only circumstantial evidence.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.960
It's not enough to arrest him.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.320
Now his alibi is no longer valid.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.119
We have the priest's previous composite sketch...

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.200
and the hospital's surveillance footage of him.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.000
Sure, it might not be enough to charge him,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.960
but it's enough to establish a case...

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.880
and bring him back for some coffee.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.160
(Justice is Mine)

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.160
(Episode 20)

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.800
I know you don't have an appetite.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.240
Have some porridge.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.200
I don't feel as terrible anymore.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520
Dad.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920
I helped them transport drugs in there.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880
What did you say?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.200
Ma Shan Bao's cousin...

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.720
If I didn't help him, he would've been beaten to death.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.280
I already got his cousin killed.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440
Son.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.760
Once some things are in the past,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
just let them stay in the past.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.080
We have to move on.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.800
Will they let us go?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.960
Do I need them to let us go?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880
Have some porridge.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480
For the construction of nursing homes...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.480
in the Western District,

00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:51.720
we will...

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760
(Guest Resting Lounge)

00:03:52.761 --> 00:03:54.200
So? Did they reply?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640
Why don't we burn it down...

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.120
like the Huyan Wooden Shed Area?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.800
It'll make up for my mistake.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960
Let's wait for a reply first.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.840
Wait? We've been waiting for days.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
Once they've made a decision,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.240
they'll let us know.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
By the way,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.600
there are two donation guests...

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760
who want to take a photo with you.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.080
I don't have time for them.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.840
Let's wait until it starts.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.840
I'll head out first.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.160
(Guest Resting Lounge)

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.279
When Councilor Huang Xiao attended the charity auction...

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.720
for the construction of nursing homes,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.160
he suddenly had a heart attack...

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.520
and passed away despite emergency treatments.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.800
We will hold a memorial service...

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.720
to commemorate his service to the people.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920
Councilor Huang!

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.120
Councilor Huang.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280
Councilor Huang.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.400
Councilor Huang!

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.400
He's not breathing.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.560
- Call an ambulance. - Councilor Huang!

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.040
I think I saw him in prison before.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Good morning, Judge Qin.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400
It's a holiday today.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.760
I don't think you have a trial.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.920
So, please come with us...

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.520
to assist in the investigation of Han Gang's murder.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.400
Since you asked me to assist in the investigation,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.600
let me analyze the logic with you.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040
First of all,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.480
it doesn't matter if Mr. Fei remembers it or not.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.680
Even if I wasn't at his shop...

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.400
at the time of the murder,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.560
it doesn't mean I was at the crime scene either.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560
Second,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.440
the composite sketch...

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.240
only shows a pair of eyes.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.880
Whether it looks like me or not...

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400
is subjective.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720
It's very abstract.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800
Third,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.320
the hospital is a public place.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.800
Why would my presence there...

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.440
arouse your suspicion?

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.120
It's because the hospital...

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.720
has no record of you visiting a doctor there.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.680
I wanted to see a doctor,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.320
but I didn't end up doing it.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.199
But you showed up at the same hospital...

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.560
three days in a row.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.360
You said it yourself.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.720
Hospitals are public places.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.640
You don't usually wear a hat.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920
Why?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
Are you feeling guilty?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.120
What?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.400
What's wrong with wearing a hat?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400
You're right.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160
I do have...

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.760
some male health problems.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.519
I went to the hospital for three days.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.119
But in the end,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.239
I still felt too embarrassed...

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.640
to tell the doctor.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.640
That's why I didn't see any doctor in the end.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.760
I just went to the pharmacy to buy medication.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.440
Well?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.560
Was I of help to you?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.280
But you have to remember,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.879
the burden of proof...

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.200
is still on you.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.239
Your son, Qin Yi Wei,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.600
also showed up at the hospital before.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.239
That was because...

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.400
he hit Han Gang with his car.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.160
Then, you appeared at the hospital too.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320
Was it because...

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.280
Han Gang wasn't dead yet?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.520
My son has taken responsibility...

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.920
for his mistake.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.440
You can suspect me of anything,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.720
but first, you need evidence.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.480
I want to remind you.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.520
In this case,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.879
there was also an innocent young man...

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.880
named Ma Shan Bao, who died.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.000
He was a year younger than your son.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.800
Don't tell me things that have nothing to do with me.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.360
Are you done?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
Are we letting him go like that, Madam?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.360
Regarding Han Gang's case,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.360
he must be hiding something.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.320
In this case,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.959
there was also an innocent young man...

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960
named Ma Shan Bao, who died.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.280
He's a year younger than your son.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Dad.

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:32.320
If you came back any later, I would've asked Grandma for help.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.400
It's okay.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.440
You don't have to worry.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.000
This Han Gang incident started because of me.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.680
This is my problem too.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.079
The police are suspicious,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080
but they have no evidence.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.880
I'm most worried about Han Lie now.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.840
He knows how his brother died.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.800
That's why he got someone...

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.160
to force you into drugs in prison.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.160
He's trying to get back at me.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.120
He won't leave us alone.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.960
That's why you have to leave.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280
Let's leave together.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.559
You go first. I'll come later.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.040
- I'm not leaving without you. - Yi Wei.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440
Okay.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
We'll leave together.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.360
At least, on the surface.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440
How about this?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.840
You go back to college. Apply to repeat your studies.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.800
I'll continue to be the Chief Justice.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.520
What about Grandma?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.400
We'll take her with us, of course.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.480
Tell her...

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.960
that we're planning to go on a trip.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.000
The less she knows, the better.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.559
She must never find out...

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.120
the truth of Han Gang's death.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.960
Dad.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880
That scumbag deserved to die.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.040
I never regretted it.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.480
If I could go back in time,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.360
when I was in law school, I'd tell myself...

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.280
that it is people who protect the law,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.960
not the law that protects people.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.800
People are bound by the law.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.880
Laws are bound by reason.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.600
Procedural justice...

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840
is a balance.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.200
Or you could say, it's a safety net that protects the public interest.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.400
There will always be a moment...

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.800
when you feel hopeless.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.560
All judicial methods seem useless.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.960
You don't know what's right.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280
At that moment,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.800
you have to ask yourself...

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
who you really are.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.520
Then, you'll know...

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.200
how you should judge.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.160
You...

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.679
are indeed not human.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.759
You are a mighty being.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.760
Don't you know...

00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:27.200
that he's a prominent figure?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.680
If you don't have definitive proof,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.320
don't go looking for him.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.200
Boss. Madam.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.200
There's a lead on one of Han Gang's men.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440
I'll head over there.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560
Tang Xuan.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.719
Why don't you focus on one case?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.280
Let someone else handle the other.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
It looks like two cases,

00:10:46.001 --> 00:10:47.200
but it's actually one.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.159
The deaths of Ma Shan Bao and Han Gang...

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.159
must be related to Qin Yu and Han Lie.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160
So these two cases...

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160
can't be separated.

00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:54.280
They must be investigated together.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.520
Okay.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.160
- Jia Jia. - Tang Xuan.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560
Are you on duty?

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240
What's going on?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.879
The wound was soaked in water.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.000
It's severely infected.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.000
But he's still alive.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080
As long as he's not dead.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.680
What do you want?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.840
We don't want anything.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.800
We won't arrest you.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.200
We'll even let you go.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.999
As for when your boss will find you,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.200
and what he'll do to you,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.320
we have no idea.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.240
What if I want to turn state's evidence?

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.400
Then I'll have to see...

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.120
if you're worth it.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
How impressive.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.880
He goes to the court on time every day...

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.520
and goes home after work.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.560
He really sticks to a nine-to-five schedule.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.960
Mr. Qiang.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.040
It's time to make a move.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.400
Young Master Gang has been waiting for a long time.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.960
Hello.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600
Xiao Lu has been rescued.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.200
He's in the hands of the police.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.120
You want to catch a big fish, don't you?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.760
Han Lie, right?

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.840
I saw him kill Ma Shan Bao with my own eyes.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.479
Why did he kill Ma Shan Bao?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.640
I heard he got a call from a whistleblower,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.200
saying that Ma Shan Bao was the one who hit Young Master Gang.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.120
Could it be that Qin Yu wanted to protect this son,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.640
so he tipped them off to divert their attention?

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.400
There's just one thing I can't figure out.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.360
Why did Qin Yu kill Han Gang?

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.360
Maybe Han Lie knows.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920
Move! What are you doing?

00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:26.120
Move! The police are on the job.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.080
We have evidence...

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.960
that Han Lie is involved in Ma Shan Bao's death.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.280
We need to bring him in for questioning.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.360
Young Master Lie isn't here.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.480
He went out.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520
What a coincidence.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.640
It's okay. We'll come back with a search warrant.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.880
There's no need for that.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120
If you want to search,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720
go ahead.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.480
Let's get to work.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.520
(Han Gang's younger brother)

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920
Madam.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.640
We found the nurse who quit.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.120
The hospital is near your house,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480
so every day at noon,

00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:29.800
you go home for lunch.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.359
Every time you go home,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.400
you pass by the path behind the church.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.760
It's a secluded alley.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800
There aren't many people there.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.359
So, every time you pass by,

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.400
if you see other people,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.080
you should remember them, right?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.120
I'm not sure.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.200
After all, it was more than half a year ago.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.759
Can I trouble you...

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.000
to help us identify someone?

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.560
What is this about?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.000
It's about a shooting at the church.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.600
It won't take long.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.480
Chief Justice Qin.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.079
The university lecture...

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.479
is scheduled for this Saturday.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480
Is that okay?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.600
I'm tired. Move it to next week.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.320
I'll head out then.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680
Come in, Inspector Tang.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200
Thank you, Jenny.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.880
Inspector Tang.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.879
If you don't have new evidence,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.559
you can't harass a public official...

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.560
over and over again.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680
You're right.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.360
We have new evidence.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.840
I'm sorry, Judge Qin.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.320
Madam is a little busy today.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520
Please wait.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640
It's okay.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.080
I guess you've been busy lately.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.879
You have TV interviews...

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.880
and press interviews.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.760
My wife likes you a lot.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.880
Would you mind...

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.920
signing this for me?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960
Have you...

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.960
arranged for a witness to identify me?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520
Don't be afraid.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
He can't see you.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.760
Now, try to remember.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.680
When you went home for lunch that day,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.640
did you pass by the alley behind the church?

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.600
When you passed by that alley,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.800
did you see anyone...

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.960
coming out of the back door of the church?

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880
I remember now.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.400
I saw a man.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.080
Was it this man in front of you?

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640
So?

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840
It wasn't him.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160
I'm sure it wasn't him.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.720
Why didn't you do a police lineup?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.160
If the witness sees you questioning me like this,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.320
they might be biased.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.640
If you don't present truthful evidence,

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.440
it might not be admissible in court.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.919
If you want a lineup,

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.120
I'll arrange it again.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400
Sure.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.800
But first, you have to arrest me.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.760
You don't even have enough evidence.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.280
What you're doing now...

00:18:10.281 --> 00:18:11.320
is harassment.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.000
I'm filing a formal complaint against you.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.640
If you want to file a complaint against me,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960
I can't stop you.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.200
In the same way,

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.880
you can't stop me...

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.720
from investigating further either.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.359
I've booked the flight and hotel.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.040
We can leave this weekend.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.359
Can you book cruise tickets?

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.040
I want to leave before the weekend.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.240
Why?

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.760
Cruises are more comfortable.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.080
We can relax.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.000
Do you think I don't know even if you don't tell me?

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.919
I may be retired,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.560
but I still have my connections.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.359
To put it nicely,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.360
you're currently assisting with a police investigation.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.800
Actually,

00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:54.160
you're being interrogated.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.999
Did you have anything to do...

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.040
with Han Gang's case?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.560
You didn't really kill someone, did you?

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.840
Don't you remember you promised me...

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.440
not to ask questions about some things?

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.760
I'm a little worried about you.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.160
Their target is Han Lie.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.520
I made a deal with Han Lie.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.320
If he didn't harass Yi Wei...

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.160
while he was in prison,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.999
I promised to approve his father, Han Kui Long,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
for medical parole.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.200
No wonder.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.040
You put him in jail,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.240
and then, you let him out.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.880
It can't be helped.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.160
It was an equivalent exchange.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.520
We really should leave.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.079
Too many bad things happened here.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.640
There are too many bad memories.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.600
The three of us should go to a new place...

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.720
and start over.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160
Also,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.200
we can't let anyone know...

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360
that we're leaving.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.160
I'll continue to go to court.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.320
Yi Wei will continue to go to school...

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.920
and apply for admission.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.360
The bottom line is, we can't let anyone find out.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.240
We have to leave as soon as possible.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040
The sooner, the better.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.560
I'll get ready.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.760
Also,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.480
if you and Yi Wei...

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.520
don't see me when you get on the cruise,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560
don't be afraid.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.160
You two should leave first.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.960
I'll come find you later, okay?

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.520
Why do you say that?

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.840
I'm a little scared.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.720
I'm just saying, "if".

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.040
Have a drink and calm down.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.680
What is it, Officer Hu?

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.360
Did you receive a complaint?

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560
You all know about it?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.960
That's how investigations are, Boss.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.280
We arrest whoever we suspect and question them.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.760
Is he an exception?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.960
No.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.559
He didn't send his complaint...

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.159
to the Commissioner directly.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.960
It was sent to the Chief Superintendent.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.119
Our current Chief Superintendent...

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.760
only got promoted after Da Gama passed away.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.880
So, this complaint came to me.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.760
What does that mean?

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.440
Qin Yu doesn't want to make a big deal out of it.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.760
Why is that?

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200
Use your brain.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.120
He's guilty.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.040
So he's deliberately warning us...

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.720
not to pursue him.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160
Enough talking.

00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:43.200
Let's eat first.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.640
You need energy to investigate.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200
Understand?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320
Are you going to work?

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.920
Yes, I'm on the night shift.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120
By the way,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.039
do you know a nurse...

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.439
named Ding Qian?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.759
I think she was still working...

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.280
at the Eastern District Hospital until half a year ago.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.759
Half a year ago?

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.440
I just transferred back to the Eastern District.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.040
Ding Qian?

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.840
I don't remember her.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.999
Then find out for me...

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.200
what caused her to suddenly resign back then.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.840
You want me to probe around again?

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600
Fine.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.720
Hey, the food is in the fridge.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.760
Bye.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.840
Bye.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.480
You kill people.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.840
I save them.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.560
We were never on the same path.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080
You're right.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.160
I even kill people to silence them.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.160
Next time,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.040
I'll kill you too.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520
Yi Wei.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.879
Just pack two pieces of clothing...

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880
in your usual backpack.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.280
Remember not to let anyone find out.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.440
Dad.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.840
I want to take this.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880
Of course.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.640
Take these hats.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120
When the time comes,

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.840
we'll wear them when we watch the games.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280
Sure.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.080
Madam. I'll get the CCTV footage from the security center.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.320
Okay.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.000
How are you? Were you scared?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.560
Luckily, you got there a minute later.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.840
Otherwise, who knows what would have happened?

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360
Come on.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.440
Apply for leave.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.600
I'll take you home.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.840
Tang Xuan.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.080
I found out.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.480
I know why Ding Qian resigned.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320
Now that you've gotten rid of Xiao Lu,

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.840
the police won't have any evidence to charge you.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240
You're safe now.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.720
If that judge dies...

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.560
while I'm abroad,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.160
it'll be the best alibi.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.960
You don't have to do it yourself.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.720
Leave his life to me.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.720
I have to be the one...

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.840
to avenge my brother and my dad.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.960
Although you didn't say it,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360
I know...

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960
you're very sad.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.400
You think Mr. Long died because of you.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.720
It is because of me.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.760
If I didn't send my dad away,

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.880
he wouldn't have died.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920
You sent him away...

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:57.000
because you wanted to save him.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.720
But Dad will never know that.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.760
I'll never have a chance to explain.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280
Until the moment he died,

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.440
he thought I was trying to hurt him.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.640
He thought I wanted to take his place.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.559
Who would believe that I never wanted...

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.560
to be the leader of the gang?

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640
I do.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.360
I put he plum blossom ring...

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.560
in the drawer in the study.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.160
- Young Master Lie. - That's enough.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.560
Don't say another word.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.480
Do one more thing...

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680
for me tomorrow.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.160
Tomorrow, you'll go to school as usual.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.320
I'll go to court as usual.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.359
Don't let anyone think...

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.480
that we seem any different.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.560
When it's lunchtime,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
+I,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280
you, and your grandma...

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.080
will meet at the port.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.600
Our IDs and tickets...

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.880
are with Grandma.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.960
We're leaving on the 2pm cruise.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.960
Are we never coming back?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Dad.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.280
Being a judge was your life's ambition.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920
Because of me,

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.720
you're forced to give it up.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.840
I'm not being forced.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.280
I chose it.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.760
I may not be able to sit in the judge's chair anymore,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.960
but...

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.400
I can be a father who takes care of his son again.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360
Thank you.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.440
For what?

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.840
Should I thank your grandpa too?

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.800
We're father and son. This is how it is.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.160
Eat the cake.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.040
I know you recognized him last time.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960
I also know...

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.360
why you don't want to identify him.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800
It's because he's the one...

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.440
who made the person who hurt you...

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680
get their punishment.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.840
The person who hurt you...

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.360
is definitely a scumbag.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.960
But we should bring him to justice,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.280
instead of constantly fighting violence with violence.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.520
This will only create more scumbags.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.000
Is this the kind of society...

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.880
you truly desire?

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640
Madam.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.600
The nurse has identified Qin Yu.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800
I've taken her statement.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.519
Report to Officer Hu and request an arrest warrant.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.520
I'm on it.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.160
Madam.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.159
This is the statement...

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.360
we got from Xiao Lu before he died.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040
Unfortunately,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.120
he's dead now.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.840
After Qin Yu sentenced Mr. Long to jail,

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.840
Han Gang went to Qin Yu's house...

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.360
and raped his wife for revenge.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.680
The older one is at the courthouse.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.440
The younger one is at school.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.720
Should I follow the older one or the younger one?

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.520
If we capture the younger one,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.840
there's no way the older one won't come.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360
Hello, Dad.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.759
I'm leaving school now.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.760
I'm heading to the port.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040
See you later.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400
Chief Justice Qin.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.760
Inspector Tang is here to see you.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Have a seat.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.720
It seems my complaint...

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.800
was useless.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.160
I found your motive...

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.280
for killing Han Gang.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.479
Han Gang's subordinate...

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.520
gave a statement,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.280
revealing many of Han Gang's crimes.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.080
- One of them was... - You don't have to say it.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.159
You came out of that church...

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.440
and ran into that nurse.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.440
She was also someone...

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.960
who had been hurt by Han Gang.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.160
She chose to cover for you...

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.560
because you avenged her.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.320
But I've convinced her now.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.960
She will be...

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.559
the witness who can prove...

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.320
that you were at the murder scene.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.879
I'll get a hamburger,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.680
- fries, and Coke. - Okay.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.760
Grandma, you eat.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.160
Based on my experience,

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.280
this case can be prosecuted,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600
but there's not enough to convict.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.560
We're currently searching your house...

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.720
for the murder weapon.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.200
I'm talking about the gun...

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.080
you used to kill Han Gang.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.040
Before we find the weapon,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.920
and an arrest warrant is issued,

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.840
I hope you turn yourself in.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.640
You got rid of the gun?

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.520
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.480
But I won't admit to an accusation...

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.440
that is unsupported by evidence.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.400
It is people who protect the law,

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.080
not the law that protects people.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600
Isn't that...

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.720
the principle we've always upheld?

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.800
Have you really forgotten...

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.600
your original intention?

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.560
You've been watching me do my job for so long.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.200
Don't you know I have a good memory?

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.880
I'm sorry.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.240
I'm really in a hurry.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.480
Inspector Tang.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.200
Thank you.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.960
Goodbye.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Yes, what is it?

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.440
It's Han Lie.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.560
Do you have time for dinner?

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.440
Your son will be there too.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.800
Do you think your dad will come?

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.880
Hey.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.440
I'm talking to you.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.960
I don't want him to come.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.560
But I know he will.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.760
Does he really care about you that much?

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.280
So much...

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.719
that he'd risk his own life?

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.520
Don't hurt my dad.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.680
I don't need to hurt him.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.680
Hurting you is enough.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.680
Your son said...

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320
you would definitely come.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.960
You won't ask my son to leave first, will you?

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.360
What do you think?

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.960
I hope you understand.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.280
The deaths of your dad and brother...

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.960
were obviously not accidents.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.200
This is called revenge.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.519
Isn't this something...

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.200
that your gang always does?

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.320
No matter what they did,

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.240
they are still my brother...

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.760
and my dad.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.920
To be honest,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.360
I never wanted to be a gangster...

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.360
or a gambling tycoon.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.960
I just want things to be like before.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.120
I want to hear their voices...

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.240
and see them alive.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.640
I really miss them. Do you know that?

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.280
Why are you allowed to reunite with your son?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.440
My mom died because of you guys too!

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.280
Say it.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.720
Go on.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.040
If you wanted him dead,

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.400
you wouldn't have asked me to come.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.480
You're smart indeed.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.400
Fine.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.160
Then let's play a game.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.560
This gun can hold six bullets.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.200
But I...

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.840
will only put in one.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.000
Only one of you...

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.640
can survive today.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040
No!

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.800
Dad, no!

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880
No, Dad!

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.320
No! No, Dad!

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200
No!

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.240
No, Dad!

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.280
No!

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.000
No, Dad!

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.160
Very good.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.760
I truly respect you.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.680
Last time, Luo Qiang's gun failed to kill you.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.560
I know you're tough.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.760
How about this?

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.920
Let's change the rules.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640
Three bullets.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.760
You don't have to spin it.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.640
I'll go first again.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.120
No, Dad! Give it to me!

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.000
- No! - Okay.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.039
Give it to me! Give it to me, Dad!

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.560
Give it to me!

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.080
Give it to me, Dad!

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.680
Give it to me!

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.840
Dad.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.080
You saw it.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.440
You always said I wasn't ruthless enough.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.000
I was bad enough this time.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.960
So many people will die with me.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.360
They...

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.200
They all died because of you.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.520
I want you to remember that!

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.520
Dad!

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.840
Dad!

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.280
Dad!

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400
Dad!

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600
Dad!

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.320
Dad, there's a bomb!

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.280
There are people inside.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.840
Dad, there are hostages!

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.760
There's a bomb!

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.120
Run!

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.400
- Hurry! - Let's go!

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.720
Granny, wake up!

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.440
Granny! Wake up!

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.200
Wake up! Can you move?

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.560
Let me carry you.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760
Come on.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040
Dad.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.640
There's no one else inside. Let's go!

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.960
Let's go, Dad!

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.720
Help me!

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.360
Mom!

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.480
Help me!

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.400
Mom!

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.240
Help me!

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.320
Mom!

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.880
Mom!

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.720
Mom, help me!

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.280
My granddaughter!

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.800
- My granddaughter! - Dad!

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.679
- Dad! - Yi Wei!

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.760
Yi Wei, it's dangerous!

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.319
My granddaughter!

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.320
Dad!

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.000
- Yi Wei! - Dad!

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920
Is anyone there?

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.880
Is anyone there?

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.480
Dad!

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640
Is anyone there?

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.640
Judge Qin!

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600
Dad!

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240
Dad!

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
Judge Qin!

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880
Dad!

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.720
Dad!

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.360
Dad!

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.480
Dad!

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.919
Dad!

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.479
Don't die!

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480
Dad!

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.480
Dad!

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480
Dad!

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.040
Dad!

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.560
Don't die!

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.680
Dad, don't die!

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.320
Today,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.200
it is with a heavy heart...

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.679
that we mourn the death...

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.760
of a defender of the law,

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.320
Judge Qin Yu.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.480
He believed that the law...

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.120
was the last line of defense for social justice.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.520
Judge Qin dedicated his whole life...

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.520
to the law and justice.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.760
Behind every decision he made in court,

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.480
he respected the rule of law and humanity.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.760
Judge Qin didn't fear the powerful.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
He didn't fear evil.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.920
Even in the face of danger, he never backed down.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.999
He used his actions...

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.080
to show responsibility and courage.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.200
It inspired people to have hope for justice.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.000
People always like to see...

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.600
what they want to see.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.760
Do you think he doesn't deserve it?

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.480
He was a good dad.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.120
He was a man who sacrificed himself to save others.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.120
He integrated his life...

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.200
with his faith in the law...

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.200
and his pursuit of justice.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040
In the end,

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.840
he sacrificed himself...

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640
to save an innocent life.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.560
Mom!

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.240
Mom!

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.680
Help me, Mom!

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.640
Judge Qin put his life on the line...

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.039
to show his selflessness...

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.440
for the last time.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.600
His departure...

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.640
is a great loss to the legal world and society.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.640
Judge Qin,

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.400
you will always be remembered,

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.840
not just for your achievements,

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.640
but for your character.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.800
You may have left us,

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.160
but your spirit...

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.760
will live on.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.840
Do you still think he's a bad person...

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.600
and a criminal?

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.240
I'm not a judge.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.160
I'm just a cop.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.840
Don't worry.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.040
I'll take good care of Wei Wei.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360
Mr. Qin.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.200
Thank you.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360
Rest in peace.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Our actions...

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.680
can't stay hidden forever.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240
Judgment...

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.480
is never in our own hands.
