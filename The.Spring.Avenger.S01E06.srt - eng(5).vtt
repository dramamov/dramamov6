WEBVTT

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.200
It wasn't me.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.200
I can't poison Wei Wei.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.400
We have witness and evidence.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.000
What are you trying to say?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.480
What are you doing?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.880
Let go of him!

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.740
Wei Wei! Let go!

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.239
Wei Wei.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.680
She was just pretending.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.680
No wonder I found it strange.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.480
Wei Wei.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.160
Let's play a game, okay?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.480
and see

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.930
really cares about you.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.960
Uncle, I'm sorry.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.880
Mr. Kang is right.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.800
You love me.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.680
I'll listen to you next time.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.360
I won't be naughty again.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.960
Okay.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.860
Let's go. Okay.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.330
Don't blame Wei Wei.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.200
I asked her to do that.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.380
Wei Wei is very sensitive.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.200
She has no sense of security.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.000
I thought no one cared about her.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.880
So,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.640
I want her to try it.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.280
I did a lot of wrong things.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.200
I'm sorry, Wei Wei.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.130
It's just a misunderstanding.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.120
Wei Wei.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.680
Don't scare us again.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.290
Misunderstanding?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.640
Someone just said

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.760
that I poisoned him?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.160
Also,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840
where did you get

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
come from?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.079
Mr. Mu.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.120
I... I...

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.079
I don't know.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.079
Gu Nian.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.940
He wants to frame you at Mu Wei Wei's birthday party.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.680
Be careful.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.020
Why are you helping me?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.320
Did you have a conscience?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.079
What does it have to do with me

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.560
has nothing to do with me.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.079
I just want to care about that bitch.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.660
I'm having a hard time.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.320
Miss Jiang.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.760
Can I help you?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.360
Auntie.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800
Wei Wei wants milk.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.960
Can you pour me a glass?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.680
Okay.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.360
You didn’t hurt me this time.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.970
Miss Gu, are you disappointed?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.280
I don’t understand what you’re talking about.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.840
It's okay if you don't admit it.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.400
There's a long way to go.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.130
and neglect.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.800
Those who do evil

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.920
will be punished sooner or later.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.720
Really?

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.600
Unfortunately, I never believe in ghosts.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.490
I only trust myself.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.880
myself.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.370
What a coincidence.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.960
Me too.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.920
So instead of asking God to punish you,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.920
I'll do it myself.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.040
Help!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.160
Help!

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.000
Akiyama!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.930
What's going on?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.520
Get her!

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.120
She wants to poison me.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.040
Miss Gu.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.800
You said I poisoned Wei Wei.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.010
Now you say I want to poison you.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.680
Even if you don't like me,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.820
you can't accuse me like this.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.800
That's too much.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.120
A star?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.480
How dare you bully a family teacher?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.880
Don't you know?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.400
She already collapsed.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.920
In high school,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.180
bullying classmates.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.720
Missing?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.280
If you have no evidence,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.600
don't accuse anyone.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320
Why not?

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.520
She has poison in her hand.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.520
You mean this?

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.800
This is the sports drink I usually drink.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.930
It's good for blood.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.640
It tastes good.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.320
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.360
I misunderstood you.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.480
It's okay.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.080
Akiyama.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.040
I'm not feeling well today.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.320
I'll go back first.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.960
I'll visit you another day.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.240
Nian Nian, wait for me.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.680
Nian.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.840
This time,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.520
Kang Chun Woo is lucky.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.120
Next time,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.200
next time.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.480
Kang Chunu?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.480
Why did you know

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.960
we bribed him?

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.560
Yes.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.840
Could it be Aunt Liu

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.540
accidentally leaked the news

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.240
Kang Chunyu found out.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.600
It’s possible.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.040
Nian.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.200
Well,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.520
Mr. Mu

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.280
knows about our past,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.720
will it affect your marriage?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.920
Why are you worried about this?

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.560
Mu Qiushan wants to marry the daughter of the Gu family.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.240
He doesn't care what kind of person I am.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.720
Hello, Meng.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.159
Are you looking for Nian?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.680
Hello, Meng.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.640
My phone is running out of battery.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.640
I messed it up.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.940
Let's talk about it later.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.840
Wait.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.040
Don't get in.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.840
Remember.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.440
Walk back.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.080
You cowardly woman.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.420
You always show off in front of me.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.920
When you see Mu Qiu Shan,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.200
he's like a puppy.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.280
Tell me.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.360
Who ordered you to poison

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.040
to frame Kang Chunyu?

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.920
No, no one ordered me.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.960
I just can’t stand Kang Chunu.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.600
and seduced people like a fox.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.320
That's why I...

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.480
Mr. Mu.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.440
I watched Wei Wei grow up.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.760
I would never hurt her on purpose.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.159
Mr. Mu.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.960
You must trust me, Mr. Mu.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.760
Trust me.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.040
Take it.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.120
Will someone die?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.720
Don't worry, no one will die.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.560
But...

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.680
Cut the crap.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.480
Enough.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.880
The Mu family can't keep you.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.160
Pack up and leave.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.800
Okay.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.520
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.880
Do you really believe her?

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.320
Aunt Liu has worked in Mu's family for more than ten years.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.920
If she wanted to harm Wei Wei,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.480
he would have done it long ago.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.410
We wouldn't have waited until now.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.240
Since Wei Wei is not hurt,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.160
let it go.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.080
It seems that Mr. Mu

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.920
but you don't want to.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.400
I thought too much.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.559
Wei Wei is not that important

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.880
to Mr. Mu.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.120
Kang Chunu.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.799
Don’t think I don’t know

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.240
what you're up to.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.640
You want to use me as your weapon?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.480
It’s not that easy.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.400
So Mr. Mu knows who did it.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.040
Then why did you marry

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.160
who might hurt Wei Wei?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.400
Do you really like her?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.850
It's just a business marriage.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.760
It doesn't matter if you like it or not.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760
What matters is

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.040
the interests behind this marriage.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.920
I see.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.200
No wonder everyone said

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.240
Mr. Mu is a business genius.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.840
In just ten years,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.560
in just ten years

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.160
such a small company.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.340
It's good to get up early without profit.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.160
Impressive.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.600
Mr. Jiang didn't give in much.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.280
I don’t understand.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.440
why you are willing

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.120
why are you willing

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.160
be a little family teacher?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.560
Even if you want to seduce me,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.520
there are many better ways.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.760
What about now?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.330
Mr. Mu, have you figured it out?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Jiang Chunyu,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.920
Your target is not me.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.000
It's just a nostalgia.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.580
I can't hide anything from Mr. Mu.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.120
If you want to fire me for this reason,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.960
just let me know.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.480
Next,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.520
what are you going to do?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.000
It seems

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.770
Muqiu Mountain is smarter than I thought.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.320
But it's okay.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.840
I've been waiting for ten years.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.200
Everything can take its time.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.820
Sister.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.440
Sister

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.260
You can't drink like this.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.380
You'll have gastric bleeding

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.440
Kang Chunyu is really a rat in the gutter.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.320
So disgusting

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.440
I swear

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.040
I'll make sure she can't survive.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.320
She can't die.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.240
Liu

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.720
talk nonsense?

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.240
Don't worry, sister.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.400
She wouldn’t dare.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.600
Meng’s cooking

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.960
is getting better.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.000
So comfortable.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.080
Meng’s body

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.560
is getting better.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.480
Meng has grown up.
