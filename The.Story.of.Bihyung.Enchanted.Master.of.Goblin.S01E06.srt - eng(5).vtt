00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.790
Yes, well done.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.780
Then why are you doing this to me?

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.320
I'm being nice to you.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:15.910
What?

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.360
Two more. Four more.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.630
Thirteen, two more.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.090
One more.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.210
This is a victory for mankind.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.110
No, it's Ha Keumbok's victory.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.550
Keumbok.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.050
Did the audition not go well today?

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.850
How did you know...

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.430
Were you stalking me?

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.420
You said it was your first time
riding a motorcycle just now,

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.840
yet you didn't look excited.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.410
That's how I knew.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.510
My father said

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.180
since ancient times,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.680
men should have stamina

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.530
to repay emotional debts.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.670
I will help you by your side.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.950
You're a real man.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.670
I'm a sub-man.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.070
I'm a subordinate, after all.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.870
When I go home, Bihyung is going to
make fun of me and torment me.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.470
I wish he were half as gentle as you.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.590
After all, Bihyung is a real man.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.650
He's already downing makgeolli
in broad daylight.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.050
He's a real man.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.780
You were drinking so much
you didn't even realize someone was back.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.910
I knew.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.430
Then why are you still acting like this?

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.510
Drinking only alcohol
will hurt your stomach.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.460
So naggy.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.610
[Delicious Squid]

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.060
So,

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.410
let's eat together.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.910
I'm not Bronzebok

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.620
or Silverbok,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.690
but Keumbok.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.540
That stands for "gold"
and "good luck."

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.610
Aren't you jealous?

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.760
Are you drunk?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.110
I was scammed by that company.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.650
I was really unlucky today.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.730
I'm going to fix this face

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.060
and work out harder.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.150
I'll work harder
to improve my acting skills.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.320
Anyway,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.460
I'll do my best.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.390
Are you stupid?

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.440
What?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.070
You were just unlucky.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.300
Why are you blaming yourself?

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.820
What should I do, then?

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.900
Just curse.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.350
You can just lie down and throw a tantrum.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.680
Curse at who?

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.020
Those up there.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.670
You really are a real man.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.320
What is that?

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.340
I think

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.060
even if you got into a fight
with those up there, you would win.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.710
Right.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.080
I wouldn't lose.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.290
So, tell them this for me...

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.800
How may I help you?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.640
Excuse me.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.660
One bottle of soju, please.
The one with the red cap.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.990
Why is this not in Korean?

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.550
Do you not sell soju here?

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.880
Then...

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.250
give me the same thing.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.980
Well, sir,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.960
this isn't on the menu.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.920
It's okay.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.500
Make him the same one.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.420
You were just treating me like a stranger,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.850
yet you still asked me out.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.550
You've grown up a lot.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.350
Is the wound

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.920
better?

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.720
Don't act like you care about me.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.350
You don't care.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.630
Please stop seeing Keumbok.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.380
Who are you to say that?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.120
I'm begging you.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.160
If it weren't for Keumbok,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.280
there would be no reason for us to meet again.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.330
You just had to hurt me, even at the very end.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.740
Hurt you?

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.770
Does Keumbok know?

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.120
That you wrangled me to near death
and kicked me out?

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.920
You were the one who betrayed first.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.950
But you never asked me why I did that.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.470
I mean,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.980
you never even gave me a chance to explain.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.610
You broke your promise.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.030
Goblins don't tolerate betrayal.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.460
That's all.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.550
All just because I'm a darn fox

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.170
who'd dig out human intestines to eat.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.100
What?

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.900
You said I gave you goosebumps.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.240
That you didn't even dare to look at me.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.670
I didn't! Iâ€”

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.610
See?

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.680
That's not it.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.290
Then what is it?

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.380
Well...

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.160
Well...

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.010
You're still bad at lying.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.740
If Keumbok and Bihyung
both fell into the water,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.000
who would you save?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.650
Keumbok, of course.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.970
Seems like Bihyung
isn't as important as he used to be.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.430
Goblins don't fall into water.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.220
And you used to treat Bihyung like I doâ€”

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.920
Me?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.570
Do you think I'm as obsessed
with Bihyung as you are?

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.650
That's not obsession,

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.090
but loyalty.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:03.720
That darn loyalty.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.700
Bihyung.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.770
I'll save you.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.980
So darn persistent.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.480
Both you

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.720
and me.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:30.140
My grandpa said
I'm the most handsome man in the world.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.080
If there were an adult version
of the Cabbage Beauty Pageant,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.930
I'd be the champion.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.520
Yeah, that's right.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.750
You'd be first place.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.170
Be it Mr. Cabbage or Mr. Lettuce.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.290
Tsk!

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.430
I can only be first place
if you're not around.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.000
You're just pretending to be drunk, right?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.120
Open your eyes!

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.540
You're so handsome even when you're drunk.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.080
Gosh, this is so annoying.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.380
Goodness.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.810
Who's the landlord and who's the tenant?

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.670
It's cold.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.810
So cold.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.300
Warm... Ahâ€”
