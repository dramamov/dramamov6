00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.590
(This is my third year of PTSD treatment.)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.840
Stay back!

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.800
Stay back!

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.550
No!

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.620
(But)

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.920
(some nightmares)

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.870
(really never go away.)

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.460

breaks out of its cocoon...)

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.900
(Two years later, Jiangyu City)

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.800
Jian Cheng,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.990
it's your sister's birthday.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.560
Your mom wants us to get along.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.670
(Follow traffic rules.)

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.560
Let's make peace.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.670
Sure.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.520
Fire Jiang Yawei.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.840
(Jian Cheng,
youngest daughter of Changsheng Group)

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.480
Jian Cheng,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.870
if you must call off our engagement,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.480
it's not impossible.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.160
Jian Cheng,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.230
you might not like it,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.680
(Zhou Yufeng, third Zhou son)
but in our circle,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.870
we get married in name only.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.310
Isn't it pretty normal?

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.350
Jian Cheng.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.320
Jian Cheng, calm down.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.820
(Jian Wenqian's Birthday Banquet)

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.950
Happy birthday.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.790
Thank you.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.590
She's just an adopted daughter.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.870
Why is the setup so grand?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.050
The real daughter

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.310
had an incident in high school.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.590
Now all the attention's on
the adopted one.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.990
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.040
Happy birthday, Miss Jian.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.880
Thanks.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820
(Jian Wenqian, adopted Jian daughter)

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840
Hi, sister.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.680
Happy birthday.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.960
One less year to live, huh?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.080
Cheng.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.640
Is that how you talk?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.120
(Mei Lan, Jian Cheng's mother)
Mom,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.780
her presence at my birthday

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.240
already means a lot to me.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.400
It isn't that big a deal.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.960
When it's your funeral day,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.240
I'll still be there for you.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.360
Jian Cheng.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.680
Can't you be more like her?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.840
Speak with more tact.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.360
True.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.560
I should take notes from you.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.910
I should learn from you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.400
how to go from
living under someone's roof

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.240
to taking over their home

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.630
and how to become a star.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.000
- Cheng, you...
- Look,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.240
so what if Jian Wenqian is favored?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.430
Jian Cheng is the one
marrying Zhou Yufeng.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.670
- Exactly.
- That's why

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.630
Jian Cheng holds all the cards.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.960
Pretending takes so much energy.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.800
Excuse me.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.270
Stop right there.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.120
Are you out of your mind?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.990
Did you really have to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.240
make a scene with your sister today?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.280
Yes, Ms. Mei.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120
If I'm upset,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.280
no one else gets to feel good either.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.630
This kid...

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.840
How can you talk like that?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.160
This...

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.240
I'm furious.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.120
Mom, don't let it hurt your health.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.560
Jiang Yawei.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.300
(Jiang Yawei, Zhou Yufeng's secretary)

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.520
What are you doing here?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.280
Wenqian invited me.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.760
What,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.190
being Jian Wenqian's lapdog

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.240
will get you a title from Zhou Yufeng?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.910
That logic doesn't add up.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.680
Miss Jian, I don't understand.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.430
Miss Cheng,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.280
Miss Wenqian's necklace is missing.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.520
Madam wanted to know

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.360
if you've seen it.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.200
The necklace?

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.240
Miss Wenqian's birthday gift from Madam.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.520
It was left by the Grand Madam.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.120
Where's the necklace?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.240
Did you take it?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.630
Maybe she's wronged.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.750
You mean the pair Grandma left?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.750
Jian Cheng, stop fooling around.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.070
Apologize to your sister

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.240
and give it back.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.840
Cheng.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.000
It was Mom's birthday gift to me.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.560
I know you've always loved it.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.000
I'd give you anything you liked
since childhood.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.750
Take it if you want it.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.560
Just don't upset Mom.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.870
Why did she hit people?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.220
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.390
Jian Cheng's still as arrogant as ever.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.070
She took her sister's birthday gift

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.190
yet still acts like this.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.510
The one she lost was left

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.240
by Grandma to me, right?

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.490
Yeah.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.560
But I already told you,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.310
I'd buy you an even pricier one.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.870
Besides, it was my gift to your sister.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.870
If you're mad, take it out on me.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.190
Don't snap at your sister.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.230
Jian Cheng.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.510
Enough already.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.910
You don't trust me?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.870
Give it back to your sister

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.070
and apologize to her.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.150
Are you alright?

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.680
Seeing Mr. Zhou's attitude...

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.510
Those rumors from before must be true.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.070
What rumors?

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.710
Jian Cheng was the one

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.120
who pushed for their engagement.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.590
Fine.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.710
Are you crazy?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.670
Sorry.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.680
Found it, found it.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.750
It was on the sofa
in Miss Wenqian's room.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.950
When Mom gave it to me yesterday,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.390
I was so excited.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.510
I forgot to put it back.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.750
I was up all night
going through the files

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.080
and forgot it.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.240
Cheng, I'm sorry.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.710
See?

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.390
It's her who can't think straight.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.920
Zhou Yufeng.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.680
Your brain's rotten
with your morality.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.870
If there's something I want,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.190
I don't need to steal it.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.630
You think I'm as petty as Jiang Yawei?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.840
Jian Cheng.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.910
That's enough.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.710
Jian Cheng.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.560
This necklace was left to me by Grandma.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.600
Your adoptive mother

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.190
had no right to give it to you.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.830
Only if

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.160
I don't want it anymore

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.240
can you take it.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.630
I don't agree.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.630
So you're stealing it.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.270
Interesting.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.870
Jian Cheng doesn't care

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.510
about her family's reputation.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.000
Can she still marry
into the Zhou Family?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.240
Look who Mr. Zhou is protecting.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.790
Such a disgrace.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.310
Are you okay?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.840
Jian Cheng.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.390
You're this jealous?

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.630
Can't even accept your sister?

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.910
Right now,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.630
you feel like a stranger to me.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.530
Then let's go back to being strangers.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.540
(Jian Family)

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.560
I'm not marrying him.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.790
The wedding is off.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.960
You…

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.720
Jian Cheng.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.390
Do you know what you're saying?

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.310
Cheng, don't upset Mom and Dad.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.350
Stop being stubborn.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.520
Cut it out.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.850
The wedding is canceled.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.000
Uncle Jian.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.510
- You insisted on the wedding.
- Dad.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.630
Now you say it's off, just like that?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.750
The invitations have already been sent.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.390
If the wedding is called off,

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.310
(Jian Hongyun, Jian Cheng's father)
how will the Jian Family save face?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.830
You're too arrogant

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.750
and spoiled.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.870
Aside from Yufeng,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.320
who else would marry you?

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.870
That incident back in high school

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.630
already ruined your reputation.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.390
Hongyun.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.030
Enough.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.440
Jian.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840
My reputation's bad.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.990
I'm not good enough for Zhou Yufeng.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.600
I told you to stop talking so much.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.800
Jian Cheng.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.480
Let's talk about it
when you've cooled down.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.200
Alright?

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.750
Jian Cheng.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.390
Cheng.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840
Stop acting up.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.440
I've seen this scene through
with you tonight.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.480
Next time, it'll be your turn.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.320
Cheng.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.670
Don't mind her.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.550
This time, just leave her outside.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.960
No one is allowed to interfere.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.600
Uncle Jian, Aunt Mei.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.440
I'll head out too.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.510
Yufeng.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.480
You and Jiang Yawei...

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.030
Mom, mom, mom.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.440
Cheng already made Zhou Yufeng mad.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.960
And she wants to call off
the engagement.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.320
If Yufeng really backs out,

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.840
Cheng might never get married after that.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.840
She's just acting up again.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.910
She's never gotten over it.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.960
An engagement

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.080
isn't something you cancel lightly.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.480
Relax, Mom.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.480
That's just how Cheng is.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.840
She's made a fuss so many times.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.200
She's trying to scare Yufeng.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.040
She won't cancel it.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.200
Jian Cheng.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320
Qin Zhuo.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.440
I want to see Uncle Zhou.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.110
Why?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.960
I want to call off my engagement.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.910
Yufeng won't agree because of Uncle Zhou.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.440
So I'm hoping Uncle Zhou
can help me again.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.060
(Qin Zhuo)

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.030
Yufeng really can't be trusted.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.280
Are you in a rush?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.040
Very much.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.080
Jian Cheng wants to call it off
with your nephew.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.920
She wants to see you.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.180
(Zhou Tingyan, President of Qianyi Group)

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.840
Yufeng is indeed having an affair.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.790
This is the video
of their birthday party.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.280
Are you crazy?

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.750
Mr. Zhou, Miss Jian has arrived.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.680
Uncle Zhou.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.680
Your face…

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.440
Was it Yufeng?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.160
No.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.110
Uncle Zhou.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.320
I want to break off my engagement.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.890
But Yufeng's wary of you.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.300
He doesn't dare to end it.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.910
Could you talk to him for me?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.320
After this, I'll never trouble you again.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.550
The wedding is three months away.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.080
You'll face consequences if you

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.390
cancel it now.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.910
No matter what,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.600
I'm calling it off.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.390
I'm sure I don't want

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.280
to marry him.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.560
Uncle Zhou.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.080
You're the only one

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.030
I can resort to.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.510
After this time,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.440
just pretend I never saved you.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.790
I won't bother you again.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.900
Three times is the limit.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.360
You once saved my life.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.080
I'll grant you three wishes.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.360
Two have been fulfilled.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:18.920
One is still left.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.560
This last wish…

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.160
Whatever you ask,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.150
I'll say yes.
