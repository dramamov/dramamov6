00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.840
Chairman Jian,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.900
I know why you came this time,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.200
but I still want to ask you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.960
how you want to handle this.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.840
Naturally, it's about turning
big problems into small ones,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.000
and small ones into none.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.230
Honey.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.190
Mm.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.710
What's your take on this?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.870
This Shenghui

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.590
is just a subsidiary
under Changsheng Group.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.710
With the head office so far away,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.510
how could it possibly know everything

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.310
the subordinates are doing?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.760
You mean

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.510
to bring out that person in charge

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.050
and let him take full responsibility?

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.310
Yeah.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.790
The incident was caused by him
taking kickbacks from suppliers.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.290
If he doesn't answer for it, who will?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.070
If you were calling the shots
at Changsheng,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.510
how would you handle it?

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.040
First, issue a public apology.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.040
Then pay whatever compensation is due

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.760
and redo whatever needs redoing.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.400
Keep a humble attitude.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.510
Offer fair compensation.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.200
The owners won't cause trouble then.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.500
What about the online crowd?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.480
The internet's full
of keyboard warriors now.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.840
Most people just follow the trend.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.240
How do we shut them down?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.360
Uh-huh.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.400
Most people online just watch for fun.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.690
This incident was caused
by a minor head at Shenghui.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.740
As the chairman of a group,
I personally came forward to apologize,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.690
which is sincere enough.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.940
Why try to silence them at all?

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.120
Why waste effort shutting them up?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.590
They can talk.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.960
I have money.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.130
Have the Public Relations Department

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.410
hire a bunch of internet trolls

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.380
to steer the conversation

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.400
and flip the trend.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.520
Say, upon learning about this matter,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.990
the Group has taken action to fix it.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.030
That's a positive spin.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.800
I'm honestly speechless.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.590
When trouble hit,
the first thing you did

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.960
wasn't to actually solve it properly.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.750
Instead, you tried to shut people up.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.030
Cheng,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.560
you don't get how these things work.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.080
Do you know how many people

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.080
are waiting to see Changsheng crash?

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.750
What if

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.590
a rival pulls some tricks
to escalate the situation

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.750
or someone greedy wants to make trouble

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.360
by using those greedy owners?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.310
Then things will really explode.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.150
Alright, you guys keep talking.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.690
I'm heading back for my beauty sleep.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.690
Is Changsheng Group really
on the brink of closing down?

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.750
Is my 9% shares about
to lose value?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.430
Ugh, that's stressful.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.590
Tingyan,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.870
what do you think?

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.880
Jian Cheng has more foresight
than you guys.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.360
If a subsidiary under Qianyi Group
faced this situation,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.360
I'd go with Jian Cheng's approach.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.870
That's easy for you to say.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.870
What?

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.750
Are you calling me insincere?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.690
Aren't you being insincere yourself?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.360
You know full well
Jian Cheng's plan works.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.630
Then why are you still trying
to take shortcuts with me?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.000
Because you don't want
to pay the huge rework labor costs.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.800
Sure, Changsheng Group can cover it,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.870
but you'd rather not spend that money.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.560
So you're using my ties
with the TV Station

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.040
to give Changsheng Group a hand.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.190
That way, if Changsheng runs
into trouble later,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.070
we'll both be stuck in the same boat.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.840
Chairman Jian,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.200
you've got quite the game plan.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.480
It's not impossible for me
to help Changsheng.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.430
It depends on what you can offer for it.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.800
From now on, in every deal
with Qianyi Group,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.190
Changsheng gives up 3% profit.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.070
I'm afraid we won't be working together

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.910
again in the future.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.000
Or do you actually think

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.800
that I'd be swayed by your 3% profit?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.310
There's something
I've been meaning to ask.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.430
What makes you so sure

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.750
I'd help your company?

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.560
Cheng also holds shares in Changsheng.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Cheng holds shares?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.480
Everyone knows you treat
your adopted daughter best.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.600
You gave her a large amount of shares.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.480
But she and Jian Cheng
have deep conflicts.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.430
How can you be sure
that when you're old,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.560
the siblings won't knock Jian Cheng out?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.640
How could that be?

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.270
No matter what,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.120
Cheng is still my own sister.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.920
I'd never be cold enough to kick her
out of Changsheng Group.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.200
Chairman Jian,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.650
I won't hide the truth from you anymore.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.430
After Reporter Sun got the evidence,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.680
he immediately called me.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.430
For my sake,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.120
he gave you all a second chance.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.680
He only hoped you'd follow the rules

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.920
and safeguard every owner's rights.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.120
But you guys,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.240
before he even hung up,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.360
snatched him away halfway through

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.560
and roughed him up.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.600
Even after that beating,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.310
Reporter Sun still asked for my opinion.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.800
I told him not to compromise

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.680
and fight you to the very end.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.870
You!

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.680
You want to ask why I did this, right?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.240
Small-leaf sandalwood beads.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.920
How do you know my wife doesn't like it?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.120
You give all the best things
to Jian Wenqian.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.190
You didn't want to marry Wang Niannian.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.390
And you let her take the blame.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.280
You made her offend people for you.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.360
Do you know how others might attack her

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.600
without being aware of it?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.800
With such a biased brother like you,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.120
how could you not knock your sister out?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.190
Jian Cheng is family to you,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.600
but she's married to me.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.360
She carries my surname.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.120
If you bully her again,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.190
you're disrespecting me.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.000
But you should be glad that Changsheng

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.490
actually benefited from what happened.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.800
Because before all this,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.190
I happen to be about
to snatch your projects for one year

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.750
to make my wife happy.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.590
So, what do you want?

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.310
I want Jian Cheng's shares
to match Jian Youhui's.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.560
Chairman Jian,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.750
if I were you,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.190
I'd give all of Jian Wenqian's shares
to Jian Cheng.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.560
After all, Wenqian will get married
one day.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.000
If she holds that many shares
in Changsheng,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.630
her future partner might eye them.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.990
That'll be harder to handle.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.080
Chairman Jian,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.240
you can come to me anytime
if you need anything in the future.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.920
As long as Jian Cheng gets
what she deserves,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.490
I will protect Changsheng

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.120
in the future.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.680
Dad, are you OK?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.400
I'm fine.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.600
Zhou Tingyan is way too sharp.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.750
Luckily, he's my son-in-law.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.510
You're awake.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.470
Mm.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.790
Done talking?

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.790
Yeah, all done.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.630
Chairman Jian said there's a dinner
with the Wang Family this afternoon.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.840
I'll go with you.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.750
You agreed to it already?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.790
It's just returning the favor.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.550
After all, he did give quite a lot.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.440
Yeah.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.350
As long as we didn't lose out,
it's fine.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.690
Didn't you go to the company today?

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.550
There's a dinner
with the Wang Family today.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.290
Of course I have to come back early.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.370
You are going on a blind date
with the Wang Family today.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.300
Guess I'm getting a new sister-in-law.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.030
So I'm back to congratulate you.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.160
Youhui,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.790
do you know what this dinner means?

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.790
Yeah, I know.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:02.910
Youhui, I'm starving.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.910
Do you know tonight is...

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.990
Youhui,

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.790
I'm craving your noodles
with soybean paste.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.150
I'll come to your place tonight.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.030
Will you make them for me?

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.280
Mr. Zhou is here.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.740
They really look perfect together.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.990
Jian Cheng looks even prettier.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.870
Yeah.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.350
Chairman Wang,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.150
you've been looking better lately.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.390
Thanks.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.360
Cheng,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.270
today's a big day for your brother.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.630
Don't mess around.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.790
Be good and behave.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.390
Today,

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.390
I'll definitely be good.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.440
I'm not sure if Jian Wenqian
will behave well.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.040
Sorry.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.590
Really sorry.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.990
I got stuck in traffic, so I'm late.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.160
Seriously!

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.080
It's fine. Next time,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.630
just head out earlier.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.870
Mrs. Jian.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.510
Sure.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.460
- Niannian.
- Yeah?

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.420
(Wang Niannian, Daughter of the Wang Family)
Remember me?

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.270
Yeah.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.790
You know, today,

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.810
I wasn't planning to come.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.790
But when I heard
my new sister-in-law is you,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.390
I rushed straight over.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.150
If you hadn't mentioned it,

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.200
I'd have totally forgotten

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.390
Niannian and Cheng used
to be classmates.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.910
Now with this marriage,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.550
our families are even closer.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.630
Yeah.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.250
I've watched Niannian grow up
since she was little.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.790
I've always liked her.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.440
And now we're finally going
to be family.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.160
Exactly.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.790
As long as they are happy together,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.150
we can all be at ease.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.510
It's true.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.510
I'm gonna head to the bathroom.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.200
These two are such a great match.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.080
Yeah.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.440
We should visit the in-laws more often.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.200
- Pay more attention
- Come with me to the bathroom.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.390
- to them.
- Sure.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.750
- Don't you think?
- Makes sense.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.390
Didn't you say you want to be with me?

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.110
Cheng is here today.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.960
Ask Cheng

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.390
to mess up the blind date.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.440
I've been away too long.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.200
They're still waiting for me.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.200
I should head back.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.080
If you're feeling uncomfortable,

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.030
you can leave first.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.080
I'll come up with an excuse
for my parents.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.840
If you marry her,

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.460
I'll stay single for life.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.730
If you're fine with me
growing old alone,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.390
then go ahead and marry her.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.870
Your bad and my dad are both intent
on arranging this marriage.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.200
Do you really think this is OK?

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.990
Do you want to get married?

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.550
Of course not.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.790
Then just don't do it.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.200
(Jian Wenqian)

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.320
(Is serious.)

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.790
Jian Wenqian, you're so ungrateful.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.150
Why is your mom here?

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.030
I asked her to come and catch them.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.910
Is this really how I taught you?

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.130
- Mom.
- How dare you seduce my son!

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.220
This isn't right, is it?

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.000
Have you no shame?

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.670
Let Ms. Mei hit Jian Wenqian
a bit longer,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.510
then you step in.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.180
You say you saw them kissing.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.080
Wait, why do I have lines in this?

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.510
I can't.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.030
He's your brother.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.440
Can't believe you'd flirt
with your brother.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.200
You came to our home when you were 12.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.260
For the past 20 years,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.840
I've neglected my own daughter

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.630
and always putting you first
in everything.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.790
And this is how you repay me?

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.910
You ingrate!

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.630
Do you even have a conscience?

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.960
I could go,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.550
but your appearance
will be more effective.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.890
And you just ruined him like that.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.390
If word gets out about this,

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.720
you'll have no shame left,

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.390
and my son's life will be ruined.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.230
Mom,

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.200
I didn't keep enough distance.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.670
- It's your turn now.
- Don't blame Wenqian.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.280
- Can I skip it? I can't act.
- Just go.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.790
Such an ungrateful thing.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.630
Mom!

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.790
I saw everything.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.110
Jian Youhui,

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.390
how could you...

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.440
She's your sister.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.490
If you really don't want to marry me,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.030
just tell your family.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.280
You…

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.630
How could you do this?

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.390
Niannian...

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.200
Are you planning to marry me
just as a decoration,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.790
a cover for your covert affair?

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.670
Go. Catch up to her.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.150
Don't let her tell anyone about this.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.080
Mrs. Wang is really good
at spreading rumors.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.200
Go now!

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.390
Hi, sister.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.200
Thanks for inviting me to the show.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.440
You asked Mei Lan here?

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.990
Yeah.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.320
Your adopted daughter

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.150
is coveting someone outside

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.550
while seducing people at home.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.910
I truly have to hand it to her.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.720
Once doubt takes root,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.790
it grows in every crack.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.200
Today's stage

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.200
was built by me.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.790
But I never forced you to perform.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.960
Tonight I stayed till the last act
with you.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.030
Next time, it's your turn
to stay with me.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:04.630
Jian Wenqian,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.630
aren't you usually the calm one?

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.670
